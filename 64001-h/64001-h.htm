<h2>FOREWORD</h2>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">My</span> husband wrote
his own Reminiscences in his two books&mdash;<cite>Some Eminent
Victorians</cite> and <cite>Coasting Bohemia</cite>, and it might
justly be brought up against me that I could have nothing to add to
what he has said himself.</p>

<p>But a critic remarked at the time that there were few
&ldquo;Reminiscences&rdquo; in which the pronoun &ldquo;I&rdquo;
occurred so seldom; and it is upon this ground that I venture to take
my stand.</p>

<p>His friends meant so much to him that his talk
is all of them. But they also loved him, and the
few who are left among those of whom he wrote,
as well as the many more of the younger generation
who testify to-day to the exhilaration of his presence
and the tonic of his humour may, I hope, find in
my effort something which may recall to them his
urbane and inspiring personality.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="center">COURTSHIP</p>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> was in June of the year 1873 that I first saw
my husband.</p>

<p>Aim&eacute;e Descl&eacute;e was beginning a memorable season of
French Plays at the Royalty Theatre, and it was in the capacity of
dramatic critic to <cite>The Echo</cite>&mdash;a post to which he had
recently been appointed&mdash;that &ldquo;Joe Carr,&rdquo; as his
friends called him, sat awaiting the curtain to rise on that remarkable
performance of <em>Frou-Frou</em> which set the cosmopolitan world of
London aflame in its day.</p>

<p>He was twenty-four years of age; but he looked more, for though he
had the complexion almost of a girl and that unruly twist in his fair,
curling hair which belongs to early youth, he was broad-shouldered and
had the strong build of the Cumberland statesmen from whom he was as
proud to claim ancestry on his father&rsquo;s side as he was of the
Irish blood that came to him from his mother.</p>

<p>Not that I could have described him that evening:
the stalls were too ill lit and my excitement
over the play was too great.</p>

<p>I had but lately arrived from Italy&mdash;having <span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>cajoled my
father, then English chaplain at Genoa, into letting me &ldquo;see
London&rdquo; under the care of my brother, resident there; so
that I had just been shot from the socially restricted life of a
parson&rsquo;s daughter in the small English colony of a small foreign
town into the comparative Bohemianism of the artistic set in the London
of that day best described by my husband himself in the introduction to
his book <cite>Coasting Bohemia</cite>.</p>

<p>There was much that must have been, unconsciously to myself, of
rare educational advantage in the lovely scenery and picturesque
surroundings of my childhood&rsquo;s life on the Riviera and in
the Apennines; and my parents so loved both Nature and Art that
they gave us constant change of opportunity in these directions.
Yet I must confess that as I grew up, the chestnut groves of the
Apennines and the shores of the blue Mediterranean became empty joys
to me, and even the comparative excitement of wearing my own and
criticizing my friends&rsquo; frocks in the Public Gardens of Genoa
or the keener delight of an occasional dance in a stately palace, was
insufficient to fill my cravings; and I longed for freedom and the
attractions of the world&mdash;more especially in London, which I
only knew through visits to relatives during the holidays of a short
period of my life at a Brighton school. And it was from the house of
specially strict relatives that I definitely escaped that evening,
to come to the wicked French play with my brother and his friend and
housemate, Mr. Frederick Jameson, an architect by profession, but
incidentally a distinguished <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>musician&mdash;in later years the translator
of the Wagner libretti.</p>

<p>Mr. Comyns Carr, to whom they introduced me, sat behind us;
and, though he often told me that he marked me down as I came in,
and somehow associated me with the personality of Aim&eacute;e
Descl&eacute;e herself, I took small heed of him then, and when, as we
sought a cab at the close of the performance, he volunteered to go back
and search for a valueless brooch which I had lost, I did not have the
grace to insist on waiting for his return before we hurried off.</p>

<p>But I was not to be punished; that very incident
furnished occasion for a next meeting.</p>

<p>Through my brother he tracked me to a Bloomsbury
boarding-house, whereto insubordination to
the deserved reproof of the conventional relatives
had made me condemn myself.</p>

<p>Oh, that boarding-house&mdash;with the city clerk&rsquo;s <i
lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon mot</i>, &ldquo;Why are you like the spoon
resting in your tea?&rdquo; And the spinster convinced that the Italian
Stornelli I sang in the evening must be &ldquo;improper!&rdquo; Could
I have endured it if Mr. Jameson and my brother had not started the
glorious idea of theatricals in their rooms hard by in Great Russell
Street? And if, on the second day of my sojourn, the lodging-house
slavey had not burst into the wee bedroom looking out to the backyard
where I was putting on my hat, with the news that a gentleman was
asking for me at the front door?</p>

<p>I never guessed who it was, but, through the sunshine
that struck into the dingy hall, I saw a strong
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>figure on the door-step and, as I advanced out of
the dimness, a mouth hidden in a fair beard&mdash;thick
and long according to the fashion of the hour&mdash;parted
in a smile; then I recognised the young man
whom I had seen two nights ago at the play.</p>

<p>He had brought my lost brooch, but I don&rsquo;t think
the excuse was needed. I knew why he had come,
though at the moment an unwonted shyness had
fallen on me, and I think I did not know whether
to be pleased or frightened.</p>

<p>He said, &ldquo;Mayn&rsquo;t I come in?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And I recollect my vexation as I answered,
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nowhere to come to! The drawing-room
is full of old ladies&mdash;the sort who tell one
that a waterproof and an umbrella are the safe
dress for a girl in London.&rdquo;</p>

<p>How he laughed! the laugh that many knew
and loved him for: and any who recollect the
speckled-hen variety of the waterproof of the
seventies will not wonder.</p>

<p>Then he said: &ldquo;But you are going out. Which
way are you going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>My reply so well betrayed utter ignorance of
London thoroughfares that his next remark was
natural.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, as I know you&rsquo;re a stranger, I won&rsquo;t
say you&rsquo;ve a small bump of locality!&rdquo; he said.
And how often did he say it again in after years!
&ldquo;But you had better let me take you along. I&rsquo;m
going that way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He told the lie unblushingly&mdash;and unblushing
I did as he bade me and followed him into the street.</p>

<p>I had been brought up with the strictness not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>only of my father&rsquo;s cloth but of Italian customs,
and I felt I was doing a bold thing: in those days
my whole English adventure was considered bold
by Mrs. Grundy, and my poor father had already
come over on a hasty visit from Italy to place me
with those relatives from whom I had escaped;
but on that occasion I was simply overborne. Long
afterwards, at a crush where Royalty was present,
my husband won a bet that he would sup in the
Royal room merely by the way in which he bade
the footman drop the dividing red rope, and by the
same way of bidding a porter put his valise on a
cab, he won another with J. L. Toole as to his luggage
passing unexamined on a return from abroad.
So it was by some kindred &ldquo;way&rdquo; that he led me
forth that day&mdash;whither I knew not. And honestly,
I forget where we went. I only knew that he took
me a long way&mdash;in more senses than one&mdash;and
showed me many things that were new and told
me many that were more Greek to me than I chose
to admit at the time.</p>

<p>I was an ignorant girl&mdash;the smattering of a brief
boarding-school education counting probably far less than the
companionship of refined parents in a land of beauty, and of the sort
of cultivation in which Joe lived and revelled I knew absolutely
nothing.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know that, at that stage in my career, I ever had so
much desire to learn as I pretended&mdash;and I am not sure that Joe
cared.</p>

<p>Yet he was in those days of his youth at the height of his
enthusiasm on matters of Art; he had just written those articles
on living painters&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>specially noting the so-called
Pre-Raphaelites&mdash;which had drawn considerable notice to his
pseudonym of &ldquo;Ignotus,&rdquo; and he was, at the moment, one of
Rossetti&rsquo;s favoured young admirers.</p>

<p>But I knew nothing of all this; nor of his having already begun
his career of a &ldquo;wit&rdquo; as Junior of the Bar on the
Northern Circuit. In fact, what I recall of him then is not his wit
but his tenderness. He was the ardent pursuer, the first man I had
met with whom I was afraid to flirt, because&mdash;in spite of some
tremulousness in his eager insistence&mdash;there was something that
said: &ldquo;I mean to succeed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So I stood dreaming before the masterpieces of the National Gallery,
and he, I am bound to say, was content with much silence as we sat in
the large, cool rooms on that hot May day.</p>

<p>Later on, when he was showing me what to admire,
I would teaze him by pointing to some atrocity
in Art, and say: &ldquo;That is what I really like.&rdquo;
But not that day.</p>

<p>And when the hour came for me to return to
the boarding-house, I think his sole thought was
upon the contriving of our next meeting. As we
passed the British Museum&mdash;he looked up at the
windows of my brother&rsquo;s rooms facing it, and said:
&ldquo;Sheridan Knowles&rsquo; &lsquo;Hunchback,&rsquo; you said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;And I do Julia and Mr.
Jameson Master Walter. But it may all fall through
because he can&rsquo;t find a man for the lover. It is
desolating.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I can recall the slow look he gave me; but then
he smiled and said: &ldquo;Is that what you would
say in your foreign tongues?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>I got cured of such expressions later on, but
that day I think I was ashamed of my careless
speech, for I knew better; and I shook hands with
him with a sense of disappointment as the slavey
opened the door into the dingy brown hall. Had
I been too flippant and free to please such a clever
man?</p>

<p>That evening, however, when I went to the rehearsal
in Great Russell Street, Mr. Comyns Carr was
there; of course he had offered himself to play that
lover&rsquo;s part. He was busy enough&mdash;though not so
busy as he had been before I knew him, when reading
for his Law Scholarship at the London University.
He had, in fact, if I remember rightly, just
returned from his first experience on the Northern
Circuit and was beginning to supplement his earnings
at the Bar by literary efforts. But he was not
too busy for this adventure, and there followed
three weeks of rehearsals under Mr. Jameson&rsquo;s
management, during which my assets for the stage
were calmly discussed, Mr. Jameson declaring that
they were good, and finally winning my brother&rsquo;s
consent to the bidding of his theatrical friends&mdash;John
Hare among them&mdash;to decide the question.</p>

<p>But Joe always pooh-poohed the notion.</p>

<p>And when I said: &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m going to earn enough
to keep me in London somehow. I&rsquo;m not going
back to that dead-alive life at home!&rdquo; he only
said cryptically, &ldquo;There are other ways.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I think I was a bit huffed at the time and crowed
when a lightly spoken word of praise came to me
presently from a very authoritative quarter.</p>

<p>For one day, as we sat resting from our labours
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>in one of the window seats of the beautiful Adams
room where Burne-Jones had once painted and
that Whistler had not long left, a light rap fell on
the door and a voice long loved by us all called
out: &ldquo;Anybody at home?&rdquo; as the radiant face
of Ellen Terry peeped merrily in upon us.</p>

<p>There was little work done that day; but our
stage manager, whose old friend she was, bade
me speak one of my speeches, and she said: &ldquo;A
good carrying voice, and she finishes her words.&rdquo;
No merit to me, who had been bred in a land where
folk open their throats and where I had heard
cultivated English only; but I was naturally flattered
and, when &ldquo;the night&rdquo; came and I was awkward
and terrified and John Hare smiled pleasant nothings
and my kindly, ambitious stage-manager&rsquo;s ardour
was damped, I might have been sore cast down
but that a new excitement and glamour had flashed
into my life.</p>

<p>Joe Carr&rsquo;s &ldquo;way&rdquo; was carving its straight course.</p>

<p>Many a time I had been caught wandering aimlessly
up Gower Street pretending a shopping
excursion and swearing that I had not seen him
on the opposite pavement, and many a half-hour
had we both pretended to enjoy the Elgin Marbles
in the British Museum, but in truth it was only three
weeks after that theatrical performance when I
put my key one day into the door of the Dispensary
over which were those historic rooms and felt
rather than saw a figure behind me, and knew that
the great moment had come for me and that I was
to be carried off my feet.</p>

<p>As once before he said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span> &ldquo;May I come in?&rdquo;
And I answered nothing and left the key in the door
(of which I never heard the end), and he followed
me up to the big studio where we were to spend
the first year of our wedded life.</p>

<p>I had come there that day for a singing lesson
from Mr. Jameson and, when he returned presently,
I am sure he guessed no more than we did that in
four months he would be in America and would
have rented his rooms to us for our first home.</p>

<p class="center">THE HOME OF BOYHOOD</p>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">So</span> from that day there was no more dingy boarding-house
for me: my betrothed took me to his parents&rsquo;
house at Clapham, where I well remember the
courtly words: &ldquo;I hear I have to congratulate my
son Joe&rdquo; with which I was received by his father.</p>

<p>Small blame would it have been to parents,
ambitious for the advancement of their children,
had they only seen in me a foreign adventuress
without credentials coming to snatch one of the
flowers of their flock; yet instead of that, most
generously was I welcomed to a home of which
I have never seen the like; and if sometimes bewildered
and always non-plussed by the free-and-easy
give and take and the wonderful argumentative
capacity of that large and variously gifted
family&mdash;I felt out of it&mdash;my lover was always
unobtrusively protecting, and the artist-sister who
had always shared his tastes and sympathized
with his ambitions, often held out a kindly hand
to help me up the steep places.</p>

<p>But they were few: the sunny places, full of real romance, of
utter confidence in our future&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a
name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>rash as it might appear to
prudent elders&mdash;bright with his radiant enthusiasms and his fine
ambitions, are the things that cannot fade from my memory.</p>

<p>In those days much verse was written not then intended for
publication, but some of which has seen the light since.</p>

<p>The typical gathering, of the large family, presided over by the
wise father whose &ldquo;Landmarks, boys&rdquo;! from the head of the
table generally calmed any storm, was most often one of obstinate
argument and fierce word-fights, and stands out now as the proper
school where the keen critical faculty and the gift of ready repartee
for which many friends now remember Joe Carr, were first forged and
perfected.</p>

<p>And, be it noted, that however sanguinary
the fight, there was never any malice, never any
after ill-will among the combatants: generous
natures and a Celtic sense of humour prevented
that&mdash;not a little helped by the complete freedom
of arena left by the parents.</p>

<p>The mother ruled her household as Victorian
mothers did, and spared neither pains nor expense
for her son&rsquo;s ambitions and her daughters&rsquo; proper
advancement in the world; she welcomed their
friends with courteous Irish welcome, however
little many of their tastes might be in harmony
with her own; but she let them talk unmolested
and was content to keep her own counsel, while
she ministered lavishly to their creature comforts;
and the father&mdash;a man of few words but of strong
character and clear insight&mdash;kept his own views
undisturbed. He had nevertheless more deeply,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>though probably unconsciously, impressed them
on his children, than his children then guessed.
He was a broad Liberal, and it is interesting to note
that, in days when we were even more insular
than we are now, no fighter in the cause of freedom
was forbidden his house because he was a foreigner.
Under the auspices of Mr. Adam Gielgud&mdash;the son
of a great Polish refugee&mdash;patriots from many
lands who had sought our shelter, found their way
to that hospitable roof. Pulski and Riciotti
Garibaldi are the only other names that recur to
me, but there were more and they were all welcome.
Men of after note in the art world and in journalism
came also as friends of Joe&rsquo;s or of his sister&rsquo;s&mdash;shaken
together with charming Irish and hard-headed North
country cousins.</p>

<p>Many were the times when dinner had been ordered
for six, and sixteen would sit down at the long
mahogany table, the polishing of which Mrs. Carr
supervised daily, laden with homely but abundant
fare.</p>

<p>But Joe made many other friends in town who
never found time to visit Clapham. In spite of
his recent appointment as dramatic critic to <cite>The
Echo</cite> his new friends were less among actors than
among painters&mdash;Burne-Jones and perhaps chiefest
just then, Rossetti, whose friendship he describes
himself in <cite>Some Eminent Victorians</cite>. Nevertheless
he had met Henry Irving through the son of the Lyceum
manager, Mr. Bateman, and had often passionately praised
him.</p>

<p>To the girl fresh from the small English colony
abroad it was all vastly entertaining, though I did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>not realize then how much of a figure my betrothed
already was among the men of his time. Even
the gayer part of my girlhood&mdash;the summers spent
at S. Moritz, which my father had discovered,
as a homely village in his yearly Alpine tramp&mdash;bore
little resemblance to London excitements.
I had but rarely seen the inside of a theatre and
never a fine English actor, and my first vision of
Henry Irving in &ldquo;The Bells,&rdquo; is a haunting memory
still.</p>

<p>This was in July, 1873.</p>

<p>But this engrossing first season of mine had to be
interrupted; for Joe, having at last obtained a
commission from one of the dailies for holiday
articles which would bring in a sum just sufficient
to pay his expenses, was whirled off to the Engadine
by my brother to be introduced to my parents
as my suitor.</p>

<p>In some ways a strange meeting on both sides:
to Joe the restrictions of a parson&rsquo;s home&mdash;though
greatly modified by the manner of a foreign life&mdash;must
have seemed a contrast to the methodical
yet easy-going Clapham household; to my parents
the reckless courage of my lover&rsquo;s plan of life,
his bold enthusiasms and gay self-confidence must
have been&mdash;to my father, at all events&mdash;somewhat
startling. But my brother was a bit of an autocrat
in the family circle and knew the position which
Joe was likely to win in the London world of letters;
my sister, a very young girl, kept the ball rolling
merrily on the lighter side, while my mother quickly
discovered deep points of sympathy with her would-be
son-in-law, and the two would sit on the terrace
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>of our mountain home, looking on the green lake
with the snow-capped peaks cleaving an indigo
sky, and quote Wordsworth contentedly. To the
end of her life they understood one another; but
even my father came to recognise the value of
a fine character above creeds. Certain it is that
Joe was as much pleased with the Italian cooking
of the maid who sat on the sofa with the dish in
her hands while waiting for him to ask for a second
helping, as he was surprised at my brother advising
him not to borrow a postage stamp when five minutes
later my father proposed to settle a small yearly
sum upon me which would enable us to marry as
soon as Joe had any fixed income whatsoever.</p>

<p>As often later, his personality had won, his incurable
optimism and self-confidence had inspired
the confidence of my parents, and it was not misplaced.
They made the speedy marriage which,
he insisted, could alone lead him to success, just
possible: economy and courage did the rest&mdash;the
courage which never forsook him. For as I look
over his letters&mdash;written to me in later years when
some one of his many bold ventures had not succeeded
like another&mdash;I find the cheerful phrase
recurring: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid; there&rsquo;s a lot of fight
left in me yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Upon that&mdash;safest and most enduring of all incomes&mdash;we set
sail without a vestige of misgiving upon the sea of life; and I&rsquo;m
thankful to say that I never was &ldquo;afraid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But it was this early marriage that led Joe for a second time, as
he tells in his <cite>Reminiscences</cite>, to change his profession,
and gradually, and to the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>distress of his legal friends, to forsake
the Bar for the more immediately remunerative work of literature. I
well recollect his joyful announcement to me of his appointment as Art
Critic to the <cite>Pall Mall Gazette</cite>&mdash;the beginning of a
long period of many-sided association with Frederick Greenwood; and
that slender certainty of income provided the condition imposed by my
father: our wedding day was fixed.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="center">MARRIAGE</p>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">We</span> were married in Dresden, where my father
had taken a temporary chaplaincy.</p>

<p>Joe had a merry journey out from England with Mr. Jameson and a
gentle but less intellectual friend who was to act as best man.</p>

<p>I was told later of this friend&rsquo;s innocent boast of
conversion to free thought and of Joe&rsquo;s quick
reply: &ldquo;Why, then, you&rsquo;ll have plenty of time
to think.&rdquo; But this sterner remark was not in his
usual vein, and much oftener I think he pleased
his two friends by his immediate sympathy with
free foreign manners, most especially those of the
French, who always had the first place in his affections
as contrasted with &ldquo;bulgy-necked Germans whose
poverty-stricken tongue&rdquo; forced them to call a
thimble a &ldquo;finger hat&rdquo; and a glove a &ldquo;hand-shoe,&rdquo;
and decreed that three men must order their baths
as &ldquo;drei.&rdquo; I must add in his defence that he never
could speak or read the language; it was his mother
wit that pulled him through difficulties. Once when
alone in Dresden he was driven to ask his way in
the words of a well-known song and, even at that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>time, was probably set down as an insolent Englishman
for the intimate pronoun in his &ldquo;Kennst du
das Sidonien Strasse&rdquo;?</p>

<p>What treatment would he receive now and how
would he take it?</p>

<p>But his two friends were German scholars and good
cicerones, and led him safely to the Hotel de Saxe
on the morning of December 15th, 1873, where my
father married us in the presence of a newly arrived
British ambassador.</p>

<p>There was some obvious raillery, to which Joe
nimbly responded, in consequence of that pleni-potentiary
remarking, with grim humour, that he
wondered if these marriages were really valid;
but the gentleman took the best precautions available
in requiring the legal part of the ceremony to take
place on the &ldquo;British ground&rdquo; of his small, temporary
hotel room, and there, both of us kneeling on
two little sofa cushions, the ring was put upon my
finger.</p>

<p>My father, however, naturally wanted to &ldquo;finish
us off&rdquo; in the English Church, and I remember my
shyness when I saw the uninvited crowd which had
assembled there&mdash;I was told afterwards to see what
a high-art wedding dress would be like!</p>

<p>Joe declared that they expected it to be scanty;
if so they must have been disappointed that the
folds of my soft brocade, fashioned after my artist
sister-in-law&rsquo;s design and approved by my husband,
were much more ample than was the mode of the
day.</p>

<p>How much have we changed since the Morris
vogue!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think I minded then being the centre of
observation, even though I may have guessed it
was fraught with adverse criticism&mdash;not wholly,
as I now think, undeserved.</p>

<p>But in the friendly little party that assembled in
our modest home to wish us God-speed there was
no adverse criticism, and we went off to Leipzig
for our honeymoon <em>en route</em> for England and work,
without any of the fatiguing excitement of a society
assembly.</p>

<p>Joe&rsquo;s graceful little speech in reply to congratulations
was quite the merriest note of the simple
festivities.</p>

<p>I daresay the wine at that table was not wholly
worthy of the palate for which Joe had already
acquired a reputation among his London friends;
but when we reached Leipzig I remember his ordering
a bottle of the celebrated Johannesberg for our
wedding dinner. Possibly he may have told a
sympathetic <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon viveur</i> of this afterwards; anyhow
our first dinner invitation on our return to London
was to the house of a wealthy bachelor who produced
a bottle of the (ostensibly) same wine with the
dessert. Unluckily, Joe, on being pressed to praise
it, said with his usual candour: &ldquo;Well, my dear
fellow, you gave us such excellent claret during dinner
that you have spoiled my palate for this!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The laugh that followed compensated for an
ominous frown on the brow of our rather peppery
host, who was however placated by one of the guests
recalling an occasion on which Joe had mortified the
famous proprietor of a famous eating-house by
forcing him to admit a mistake in serving, later in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>the dinner, an inferior brand of the wine supplied
at first.</p>

<p>Two days of lazy sight-seeing in the fine old
German town, and then on we travelled; and a
cold journey we had of it! But Joe&rsquo;s spirits were
equal to every <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">contretemps</i>: even when we were
turned out at a dreary frontier junction in the
middle of the night to await a slow train, although
we had paid first class fare and had been told there
was no change.</p>

<p>There was but one other passenger in the train&mdash;a quiet,
elderly German, and when I translated to Joe the bullying
official&rsquo;s assurance that this gentleman had agreed to waive his
rights if we did the same, he made me ask our fellow-traveller if this
was the case. Unwarily the gentleman admitted that he had been told the
same thing of us, and although I was unable to put all the epithets
which Joe applied to the lying official into colloquial German, I was
buoyed up to persuade the traveller to use some of them, with the
result that a special engine and first class carriage took us all three
on to Paris by the morning. Perhaps our unknown companion was a person
in power.</p>

<p>But in Paris fresh delays awaited us. When after two arduous but
cheerful days of some sight-seeing and a good deal of aimless and
delightful wandering and strange but equally pleasant meals in tiny
restaurants&mdash;we came to the Gare du Nord on our last day, Joe
found that he had not money enough to pay for tickets and luggage, and
we were obliged to return ignominiously to the hotel and borrow from
our best man&mdash;happily <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>for us just arrived there on his own
homeward route.</p>

<p>Somehow we minded little, but we reached Clapham one day late for
the family Christmasing&mdash;arriving, indeed, when the turkey was
already on the table, and I think it took all Joe&rsquo;s tact to win
his mother&rsquo;s forgiveness.</p>

<p>So that was the end of our one week&rsquo;s wedding
trip; it was back to work and a busy time we had of
it till our son Philip was about nine months old.
Then, by dint of Joe&rsquo;s unceasing work and my
economy we found that we could allow ourselves a
journey to Italy to stay with the various friends of
my girlhood.</p>

<p>We called it our honeymoon&mdash;a belated one, like
the gift of a portrait-bust of our boy at three years
old, which Joe chaffed Miss Henrietta Montalba
for presenting to us as a &ldquo;wedding-present.&rdquo; But
none the less a honeymoon for that, though not of
the conventional and luxurious type.</p>

<p>Many a funny experience attended Joe&rsquo;s efforts
to pursue in travel the economy which I had sternly
sought to instil at home, and I am afraid that he
never again fully resumed the good habit from
which he then first broke away. Economy was not
one of his virtues&mdash;was he not the son of an Irish-woman?
But, then, generosity was. Burne-Jones
once asked him why he took a cab to drive down the
Strand, and he said it came cheaper, because if he
walked he was sure to give half a crown to some
former &ldquo;stage-hand.&rdquo; Yet when another day
Burne-Jones himself was deceived by a plausible
story and Joe cried in reproof:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span> &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see
that it&rsquo;s only acting?&rdquo; Burne-Jones replied: &ldquo;Well,
my dear, I&rsquo;ve paid ten-and-six to see worse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But in the days of our first foreign trip my
extravagant husband was still &ldquo;trying to be good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I remember his taking the English prescription
for a sedative to a small chemist on Lago Maggiore,
whom he described as the alchymist in <cite>Romeo and
Juliet</cite>; but when the dose, which at home represented
about two tablespoonfuls, arrived in a straw
covered quart &ldquo;fiasco,&rdquo; he preferred a night&rsquo;s
toothache to venturing on it.</p>

<p>As representing his sympathetic understanding
of one side of the Italian character, I might cite our
going into the quaintest of curiosity shops in an old
town where we had to wait at a junction, and his
tendering a cheque in payment of a trifling purchase.
I am bound to say he confessed afterwards that he
had only bought me the trinket in the faint hope of
getting the change he needed and that he was as surprised
as I was to see the ox-eyed little hunchback
unearth a beautiful ancient casket and hand him
from it the gold required.</p>

<p>Possibly the timid request having come from me
in the man&rsquo;s own dialect may have helped to confirm
the impression of &ldquo;good faith&rdquo; given by Joe&rsquo;s
candid countenance; but he did naturally count
on me; and on a different occasion when he was
obstinately trying to drive a bargain with an unwisely
grasping <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">vetturino</i>, his delight was great at the sudden
drop of five francs in the demand of the astounded
plunderer upon hearing his own vernacular from my
indignant English lips.</p>

<p>There were many times when Joe would have none
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>of my help. When we were staying on the Riviera
he would go every day into the town in the rattling
little omnibus that plied along the dusty road, succeeding
by sheer kindred <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonhomie</i> in making friends
with the drivers and rejoicing at the abusive epithet
of &ldquo;ugly microbe&rdquo; suggested by some late epidemic,
with which they used at the time merrily to bombard
one another.</p>

<p>His best crony amongst the friends of my childhood
was the old priest of our Apennine village who
had taught me the piano when I was a little girl,
in exchange&mdash;as he always averred&mdash;for my instruction
in my own tongue.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m afraid his conversational English was little
credit to me and not much better than Joe&rsquo;s Italian,
although the old man was a scholar and had taught
himself enough, with occasional help from my
father, to read Shakespeare in the original.</p>

<p>He pronounced the name with every vowel
broad and separate, as in his Latin; this was
easy in that case, but when he wanted to tell which
were his &ldquo;four favourite poets&rdquo;&mdash;in which list he
included musicians&mdash;he was sore put to it for the
pronunciation of Byron, Beethoven and Bach.</p>

<p>But Joe taught him more than I had done at ten
years old, for which the old man upbraided me
again as he would have done in my baby days.</p>

<p>I can see him standing in his shabby cassock
beneath his pergola with the sun filtering through
the vines on to the hanging bunches of purple fruit,
and shaking his finger at me with mock solemnity
as of yore.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;When she was four years old she told me I spoke
English like a Spanish cow,&rdquo; said he, quoting a
Genoese proverb. &ldquo;But she taught me badly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then he related&mdash;what I refused at first to
translate&mdash;how he had had to whip me for stealing
his currants.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grapes she might have had&mdash;but English
currants, they require <em>watering</em>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And grapes <i>we</i> had too, as many as we could
devour. In their natural form Joe could pluck
and eat them gladly too; but when it came to the
sour wine which the <em>Prevosto</em> had made from them
and with which he served him at table, I am bound
to confess that my husband risked disgracing me by
spilling it on the brick floor when his host&rsquo;s back was
turned; and on one occasion he even went so
far as to pour a whole half <em>fiasco</em> through the little
window which separated the refectory from the
church, where he bespattered the marble pavement
behind the high altar.</p>

<p>But these delinquencies remained a secret, and
&ldquo;Gi&ograve;&rdquo; became the old man&rsquo;s loved and patient
instructor and friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tor bay or not tor bay,&rdquo; I seem to hear him
painfully enunciating: and then Joe finishing
Hamlet&rsquo;s familiar soliloquy in slow, even tones as
they passed up the vineyards. Pleasant climbs
they were through sweeping chestnut-woods and
beside trickling trout-streams that grew to rushing
torrents after a thunderstorm; climbs that ended
perhaps at some mountain sanctuary whence the
white cities of the plain could be seen beyond
a sea of gently lowering ridges and crests; or sometimes
only at some hamlet beside the stony bed of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>the wandering river, where the old man would bid
him wait while he mumbled his &ldquo;Office&rdquo; or went
in &ldquo;to see an ill&rdquo; in one of the thatched cottages
adorned with hanging fringe of golden maize-cones
that cluster around the village fountain. It was
here that one evening, when I had been my husband&rsquo;s
companion, the village sempstress came forth to
greet us&mdash;she who had made my own and my sister&rsquo;s
new cotton frocks on that great occasion when the
<em>Prevosto</em> had begged for us, as the &ldquo;cleanest children
in the village,&rdquo; to strew flowers before the Archbishop
when he came for the Confirmation.</p>

<p>I reminded the old priest of it and he said: &ldquo;Yes,
yes! And the Archbishop asked if you were
Protestants and I answered &lsquo;Certainly! but their
parents did not refuse because we are Catholics:
we all pray to the same God.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sempstress was old when Joe saw her and so
stout that the great scissors that hung from her
vast apron bobbed as she moved; but she was handsome
still and gracious with the graciousness of a
duchess; I well recollect Joe&rsquo;s comment on it.</p>

<p>The laughing girls who clustered round us in
wonder pinched his calves, perhaps to see if they
were padded, though their excuse to old Teresa&rsquo;s
sharp and quick reprimand was that they only wanted
to feel &ldquo;the beautiful real English wool&rdquo; of his
shooting stockings.</p>

<p>Joe had not objected, but she was not placated,
and bade the hussies be off while she invited us into
her dwelling.</p>

<p>A girl sat at the hand-loom, rapidly moving her
bare brown feet and flinging the shuttle to and fro
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>for the weaving of the sheeting, a completed
length of which lay beside her ready to be bleached
on the stones by the river.</p>

<p>Joe wanted to hear about it from her, for her eyes
were &ldquo;like the fish pools of Heshbon&rdquo;; but she
jumped up at the mistress&rsquo;s bidding and he lost
interest in weaving; I think he would even have
tasted the sour wine which she presently brought
on a copper tray if I had not quickly invented a
polite fiction to the effect that Englishmen never
drink anything but tea in the afternoon.</p>

<p>A slice of chestnut cake we were forced to accept
from the elder woman&rsquo;s hospitable hand as she asked
my husband&rsquo;s name. I remember the charming
bow with which she turned to him after she had heard
it and said: &ldquo;<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">O che bel San Guiseppe!</i>&rdquo; and his
equally charming recognition of her pretty compliment.</p>

<p>Irish and Italian&mdash;there was some subtle affinity
always between them&mdash;the grave and the gay, the
superstitious and the Pagan, as <i>he</i> said&mdash;and he was
positively confused when she observed that his
golden beard and fair, curling hair were just like the
St. Joseph&rsquo;s in the Church. It was a merry run we
had down through the chestnut woods and a sweet
walk by the river in the sunset, back to the Presbytery.</p>

<p>Graver but none the less satisfactory was the
appreciation given to him by my old nurse, when
we arrived presently in Genoa. She was of a
different type&mdash;refined, sensitive, serious even to
sadness&mdash;with the blight always on her of a foundling&rsquo;s
ignorance of parentage; but devoted beyond
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>all words and of a rare intelligence: Joe was impressed
with her and likened her to a female
Dante.</p>

<p>Yet the brighter types were more in accordance
with his holiday mood: when we were on a visit
later at a mediaeval castle whose battlements stand
sheer above the sea and whose olive groves slope to a
transparent bay, he spent all the time not occupied
by eating figs off the tree on the Castle keep to
playing with half-naked brown urchins on the quay
of the tiny fishing-port below.</p>

<p>His first acquaintance with one of them was at
dead of night when we were alone in the weird old
place and a hollow bell clanged suddenly through
the hot air.</p>

<p>Joe got out of bed&mdash;his chief fear being lest the
mosquitoes should take the chance to get in under
the sheltering net&mdash;and made his way down a dark,
vaulted passage to the outer gateway and what was
once the portcullis. A ragged boy stood there with
a telegram: it was an invitation which should have
been delivered six hours before, but the boy had
walked five miles along a cliff in the dark and Joe
rewarded him so well that his fame was spread in
the village and he never more walked peacefully
abroad.</p>

<p>The little girls, however, were his chief pilferers:
he could never refuse their appealing black eyes.
And some of them were fine coquettes. I can see
him now dancing a hornpipe on the quay with a
half-clad little maiden who presently signed to him
to take off his hat; the elaborate bow with which he
did so, bidding me apologise to her for the omission,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>was worthy of the producer of many subsequent
plays.</p>

<p>The little incident recalls another of later date.</p>

<p>Then it was in the Engadine that we were holiday-making.
Mr. and Mrs. Bancroft&mdash;as they then
were&mdash;had invited us to lunch at the Campfer
Hotel and we had walked over from S. Moritz where
we were lodged.</p>

<p>As we came up the path through the pine-wood
beside the rushing stream we saw the famous little
lady standing on the dusty road above to welcome
us; and Joe&mdash;his hat in his hand this time&mdash;began
advancing towards her executing his hornpipe step.</p>

<p>To the entranced amazement of a few loungers,
she picked up her skirts in the prettiest way imaginable
and immediately responded with a pas-seul
of her own&mdash;her little feet nimble as ever, till the two
met, laughing immoderately, in the middle of the
highway just as the diligence hove in sight.</p>

<p class="center">HOME LIFE AND DRAMATIC CRITICISM</p>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">These</span> latter incidents occurred some time after
1873. When we got back to England after our
Dresden wedding we took up our abode almost
immediately in the old Adams house in Great Russell
Street. The two rooms which Mr. Jameson sub-let
to us were all that we could at first obtain above
the Dispensary, but they were large and quite
sufficient for the Bohemian life which was all that
we could then afford; anyway no subsequent home
of ours was pleasanter and nothing was ever again
so little burthensome.</p>

<p>At a long table by the door of the one large
dwelling-room the old couple who had been our
predecessor&rsquo;s factotums served our meals; and
around the handsome Adams chimney-piece at the
other end, or in the panelled window-seats looking
on the restful fa&ccedil;ade of the British Museum, we
gathered Joe&rsquo;s friends&mdash;they were all Joe&rsquo;s friends&mdash;for
a &ldquo;pipe and a chat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And what chats they were!</p>

<p>James Sime, the historian, kindliest of men with
his Teutonic philosophies and his deep Scottish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>sentiment and enthusiasm; Churton Collins richly
capping his host&rsquo;s poetical quotations and sometimes
boldly challenged for an inaccuracy; W.
Minto, afterwards Professor of Literature at Aberdeen,
who was just starting his Editorship of <cite>The
Examiner</cite>, and pressing Joe into the ranks of his
contributors; Camille Barr&egrave;re, now French Ambassador
in Rome, but then a Communist refugee
earning a living by London journalism, and of whose
friendship and instruction in French Joe tells himself;
Frederick Jameson and Beatty Kingston with
their friends at piano and violin, to say nothing
of the colleagues with whom my husband had just
become associated in his work on <cite>The Globe</cite> and of
whom he again tells in his <cite>Eminent Victorians</cite>.</p>

<p>Dare I recall the evening when my husband
proudly named me to Minto as the writer of a
little descriptive article which he had read in the
<cite>Pall Mall Gazette</cite> and the consequent suggestion
that I should do the series of Italian sketches for
<cite>The Examiner</cite> which were afterwards reprinted in
a volume with Randolph Caldecott&rsquo;s illustrations.</p>

<p>Of course I should never have done even as much
without their kindly encouragement, but to the end
of his life I think a good review of any small effort
of mine pleased Joe far more than one on his own
serious work. But I must admit criticism affected
him little&mdash;never when it was adverse and, in fact,
only when it showed real insight.</p>

<p>In his own merry manner he would say: &ldquo;People
always mean blame when they talk of criticism.
But I can <em>blame</em> myself; all I want from others is
praise&mdash;fulsome praise.&rdquo; And so it was! He had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
the need of it which came of the Celtic blend of self-confidence
and apprehensiveness. Often have I
heard him say of another of like blood: &ldquo;He
couldn&rsquo;t swim across the stream if he hadn&rsquo;t our
native conceit.&rdquo; And then add gravely: &ldquo;Believe
me, praise is the only sort of criticism that ever
helped a man on his road.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And in his own opportunities as critic and
editor he always acted up to this belief.</p>

<p>In these rosy days of our early struggles and joys,
the &ldquo;first nights&rdquo; at which Joe was due in his
capacity of dramatic critic were red-letter days to
me.</p>

<p>The occasion when Ellen Terry first played Portia
under the Bancroft management of the famous little
House in Tottenham Court Road was one of them;
I can see her again in her china-blue and white
brocade dress with one crimson rose at her bosom.
Neither the fashion of the dress or of the coiffure
were perhaps as correct to the period as the costumes
which I designed for her later on for the better
remembered run of <cite>The Merchant of Venice</cite> at the
Lyceum; but how lovely she looked and how
emphatically Joe picked her out as the evening&rsquo;s
star beside Coghlan&rsquo;s Jew! Our hearts beat with
pride at the laurels often gathered by our friend,
even in those early days before her long list of
triumphs with Henry Irving; and Joe, as we made
our way home, took some credit to himself for the
vehement advice as to her resuming her temporarily
suspended career, which he had given her a short
while before. There were never any first-nights
quite like the Ellen Terry ones to us; but there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>were many pleasant and exciting evenings&mdash;notably
the nights of Irving&rsquo;s remarkable performances at
a time when he was playing under the Bateman
management in <cite>The Bells</cite>, <cite>The Two Roses</cite>, and many
other of his early successes; also the famous runs of
Robertson comedies at the little <em>Prince of Wales</em>
theatre, where the charming Marie Bancroft was at
the top of her long popularity and John Hare&rsquo;s
delicate impersonations vied with his manager&rsquo;s
carefully studied portraits of the dandy of the day.
Mrs. Kendal was also then at the height of her brilliant
career, and last but not least, the first performances
of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas were nights
when the privilege of seats was not easily won.</p>

<p>I can recall the first performance of <em>Iolanthe</em>, and
the laughter that shook the house when the wild
applause at the close of the chorus: &ldquo;<em>Oh! Captain
Shaw, true type of love kept under</em>,&rdquo; at last brought
the Head of the Fire Brigade to the front of his box
for an instant.</p>

<p>Yet all our first nights were not &ldquo;great nights,&rdquo;
when&mdash;as a fellow-critic once remarked to Joe&mdash;&ldquo;Strong
men shook hands with strangers.&rdquo; Sometimes
they were even dull; on one occasion so much
so as to draw from one of the critics an unusually
caustic bit of advice: &ldquo;We are told that so-and-so
is a promising young actor,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;personally
I don&rsquo;t care how much he promises so long as he
never again performs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For my part I confess that the theatre was still
so new to me that I looked forward to any first night
with pleasant palpitation, though my best frock was
no doubt reserved for the choicest prospects. But to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>Joe, possibly the duty of writing the prescribed
amount on a thoroughly poor piece grew irksome;
and when, as on the occasion of the production of
F. C. Burnand&rsquo;s <cite>The Colonel</cite>, his friends and their
serious work were the butt of boisterous hilarity,
I know his loyalty found it difficult not to retort,
as he apparently did in the article alluded to in the
following correspondence.</p>

<p>It must have been written at the moment when
the campaign against so-called &ldquo;high art&rdquo; was at
its zenith, and had amused the public as it would
probably not do to-day; I should not quote it, but
for the urbane humour of Joe&rsquo;s rejoinder to the
(temporarily) incensed author.</p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right"><i>Feb. 22, 1881.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">&ldquo;Dear Carr,</span></p>

<p class="indent3">I have heard that you do the <cite>Saturday
Review</cite> theatrical criticisms. Did you do that on
<cite>The Colonel</cite>? if so I am anxious to know if you ever
read <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Un Mari &agrave; la Campagne</i>; also to ask where the
puns are in my piece? I admit three, put in
<em>carefully</em> into the right peoples&rsquo; mouths&mdash;the right
puns in the right places.</p>

<p>Why is it a farce? Unless <cite>She stoops to Conquer</cite>
is a farce. Where are the evidences of high animal
spirits in my play? I don&rsquo;t pretend to quote your
article verbatim but this is my impression of its
purport. Had I known at the time that it was your
writing I should have tackled you at once; first
because I think you are wrong, second because if
you are not, I am, and I wish to be put right. I
should like to hear your suggestions for the improvement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
of Act III. where you think I have bungled
&lsquo;into seriousness.&rsquo;</p>

<p>I shouldn&rsquo;t have taken the trouble to write if I
hadn&rsquo;t been told that you were the critic who in a
friendly way pooh-pooh&rsquo;d the notion of <cite>The Colonel</cite>
being a comedy. I am aware that Dr. Johnson
set down <em>She stoops, etc.</em> as a farce, and farcical to
a degree its plot is, but not its characters. <cite>The
Colonel</cite> I contend is comedy&mdash;farcical neither in
plot <i>nor</i> characters.</p>

<p class="center">Yours truly,</p>

<p class="date-r"><i>February 24th, 1881</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&ldquo;Dear Burnand,</span></p>

<p class="indent3">I do not as a rule write the Dramatic
Criticism for the <cite>Saturday Review</cite>, only when the
regular critic is away; but you are right in supposing
that I am the author of the article on
<cite>The Colonel</cite>.</p>

<p>Your letter was a surprise to me. I liked <cite>The
Colonel</cite> and thought I had said as much: but I
liked it in my own way and I am not going to be
bullied out of my admiration by the modesty of
the author.</p>

<p>I thought it a brightly written farce with a rather
weak last act. You tell me, and of course you ought
to know, that it is not a farce but a comedy: but if
I were to adopt your classification I should not like
it at all, and I want to like it if you will let me&mdash;in
my own way.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>
<p>You ask where the puns are and in the same
breath you tell me where they are. There are
three of them you say, and they are all in the right
places. But I never hinted, my dear fellow, that
they were not in the right places. On the contrary
it was your gravity not your humour I found to be
in the wrong place. You ask me again where are
the evidences of high animal spirits in your play;
after your letter I shall begin to doubt my recollections,
but I had certainly thought the interest of the
play was mainly supported by its high spirits.
To be able to keep a wildly extravagant notion alive
for the space of three acts, demands I think an ample
supply of animal spirits. But is it a crime to have
high animal spirits? I thought it was only the
gloomy apostle of high art who loathed hilarity.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t the faintest objection to your tackling
me, as you call it, but you must give me leave to speak
freely. When I hear you say that <cite>The Colonel</cite> is
farcical neither in plot nor characters, I begin
seriously to wonder whether your letter is not
altogether a form of practical joke.</p>

<p>I will not let myself be diverted by your allusions
to <cite>She Stoops to Conquer</cite>. The suggested resemblance
had not, I confess, occurred to me; there seem to
me many differences between the two works but
this is rather a question for posterity.</p>

<p>If, however, you insist on taking Goldsmith into
your skiff it will not be thought presumption on my
part if I choose my place in Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s heavier
craft. I would prefer, however, to take your own
account of your work. Not farcical in plot or
character! Surely your career as a humourist has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
been fed by the rarest and most delightful experience,
if it has brought you into contact with the kind of
man who would be driven to the verge of immorality
by a dado! No, I can&rsquo;t think you serious!&rdquo;</p></div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Here my copy&mdash;the rough one of the letter sent&mdash;comes
to an end; and I have not F. C. Burnand&rsquo;s
further reply.</p>

<p>But it is good to remember that there was never
any breach between the friends; I find a scenario by
Burnand for a children&rsquo;s Christmas play&mdash;evidently
sent to Joe about the time when he produced
Buchanan&rsquo;s version of the <cite>Pied Piper of Hamlin</cite>
at the Comedy Theatre with Lena Ashwell&mdash;still a
student at the Royal Academy of Music&mdash;acting
and singing the girl&rsquo;s part.</p>

<p>And from a much later period I can quote the
following further proof of unimpaired friendship
in a letter written to thank Joe for having been
largely instrumental in getting up the dinner given
to Burnand on his withdrawal from the editorship
of <cite>Punch</cite>.</p>

</div>

<p>Apropos of Lena Ashwell, I may say that Joe was
then so much struck with her talent for acting that
he persuaded her to leave the musical profession,
for which she was being trained, and gave her the
part of <em>Elaine</em> in his <cite>King Arthur</cite>, shortly afterwards
produced by Henry Irving at the Lyceum Theatre.</p>

<p>I set down these trivial memories as they recur
to me, sprinkled over many a year of work and of
anxieties, but of much merriment and many joys.
But, taking up the thread of the first year of our
married life, I recall an amusing incident which
bore some pleasant consequences.</p>

<p>Joe, as was often the case, had sat up writing his
dramatic criticism after I, tired with the still
thrilling excitement of some &ldquo;first night,&rdquo; had
gone to bed.</p>

<p>He had posted his article and was sleeping the
sleep of the just, when our hoary retainer mercilessly
awakened him early next morning with the words:
&ldquo;Gentleman on business, Sir!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He donned a dressing-gown and went down none
too willingly, to find an unknown little Scot below,
who briefly stated that he was empowered by the
proprietors of some Encyclopaedia to offer him a
goodly fee for a short life of&mdash;I think it was&mdash;Rossetti;
but that owing to another writer having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>disappointed the Editor at the eleventh hour the
copy must be delivered in three days.</p>

<p>Joe was full of work, but the sum was too princely
to be refused by a man who knew that shortly he
would have to feed an extra mouth; the impossible
was achieved, there was not even time to see a proof&mdash;and
I well remember Joe, when telling his tale
to a friend, confessing his relief that he had never
come across that volume, and could only hope that
no one else ever had either.</p>

<p>The cheque, at all events, he <i>did</i> see, and with a
part of it we went to Derbyshire for our first country
holiday. And a wild, happy holiday it was!</p>

<p>We lodged in the roughest of cottages in a tiny
village near the Isaac Walton Hotel, where Joe had
contrived to get some fishing rights. With what
enthusiasm did he show me the haunts of his boyish
holidays, the scenes of fishing adventures and of
great walks with early comrades!</p>

<p>But that cheque from the Scottish publishers
contributed to other things besides a holiday.
In the November of that year our son, Philip, was
born. Strange now to think that he, who was
in France throughout the Great War, should
have had a German for his first nurse, and that
before he could speak he could hum many a Volkslied&mdash;an
accomplishment which his proud nurse and
mother made him show off to our musical friend,
Mr. Jameson, who indeed even insisted on testing
his intonation on the piano.</p>

<p>Other distinguished folk gathered around his cradle
in the big studio. I can see Ellen Terry nursing
him in one of the wainscoted window-seats and so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>apparently carelessly in one arm while she made
wide gestures with the other to emphasize some point
she was discussing with my husband&mdash;that I, nervous
young mother, was forced to cry out at last: &ldquo;Oh,
Nell! Take care of my baby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Upon which she, in a tone of commiserating reproof,
replied: &ldquo;Now, Alice, do you suppose I
need teaching how to hold a child?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anyone who has seen her do it&mdash;even on the stage&mdash;knows
very well that she did not.</p>

<p>So the discussion went on and I even remember
the subject: for it was just when she was weighing
the offer of a fresh engagement on the stage, upon
which she had only then appeared in extreme youth.
Joe gave his advice emphatically, though he had
never seen her act then and did not know upon
what a future that door would open.</p>

<p>The opportunity was to be the production of
her old friend Charles Reade&rsquo;s <cite>Wandering Heir</cite>.
The caste was not strong, and it was not wonderful
that &ldquo;Nell&rdquo; scored a success; but I think Joe saw
more than most people in that first night at the
Queen&rsquo;s Theatre when he rushed out between the
acts and returned with a rather damaged bouquet,
the only one left in Covent Garden, which he
presently threw at her feet.</p>

<p>It was the first of many a &ldquo;first night&rdquo; when he
watched her&mdash;critical, as it was his business to be,
but sympathetic and enthusiastic always. There
was no limit to his praise, for instance, of her pathetic
portrayal of <cite>Ophelia</cite>: nor of his immediate appreciation
of that moment in her otherwise tender impersonation
of <em>Olivia</em> in <cite>The Vicar of Wakefield</cite>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>when she strikes the young Squire on discovering
his treachery. But these were only two out of
many thrilling &ldquo;first nights&rdquo; of her earlier engagements
when I sat beside him, my perfect enjoyment
not even hampered, as in later years at the Lyceum,
by my anxiety respecting the proper finishing and
donning of the dresses which I had designed for
her.</p>

<p>But that day in Great Russell Street, even Joe,
always nervous about the children, thought more
of our first born. To me her reproof had been
convincing; I never again feared Ellen Terry as
the safe and tender guardian of my children;
indeed she first taught me much delicate observation
of infants, but Joe&mdash;often terrified about them&mdash;believed
in no advice save that of his mother, who
had borne thirteen and reared eleven; yet upon one
point my shrewd Irish mother-in-law, with her
always wise but sometimes wittily caustic advice,
and the more indulgent artist were agreed, viz.
that&mdash;as our country butcher delighted Joe by
saying about his live &ldquo;meat&rdquo;&mdash;babies, though
disciplined, should be &ldquo;humoured not druv.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Although nervous in moments of crisis Joe was,
however, always calm and competent; but he
generally managed to relieve the situation with his
own irrepressible spirits at the earliest possible
moment, and many a comic tale hangs round the
strange doings of an incapable old Gamp who
tended me at the birth of my second child.</p>

<p>He would lure her with the seemingly innocent
question: &ldquo;Sweetened or unsweetened gin, Mrs.
Peveril?&rdquo; knowing well that the spirit was needed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>for friction and that &ldquo;Peveril of the Peak&rdquo; (otherwise
hook-nosed) as he had named her, would
&ldquo;rise&rdquo; every time and answer demurely: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sure <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t know, Sir. I never tasted neither.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Luckily the old lady was neither sharp enough to
see nor thin-skinned enough to mind; but who
ever minded Joe&rsquo;s wit? Though it was keen enough
at times, the urbanity behind it shone through too
well.</p>

<p>Even his wife was a willing target&mdash;and a good
one. As Edward Burne-Jones used kindly to say
when they had both tried me on their favourite
theme and taken me in over a Dickens quotation:
&ldquo;There never was anybody who rose better than
the dear lady.&rdquo; Yet I maintain that it needs a
profound student of the master to know that he has
created an obscure character named &ldquo;Pip,&rdquo; other
than the human boy in <cite>Great Expectations</cite>.</p>

<p>Well, many is the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon mot</i> to which I helped my
husband.</p>

<p>When I declared myself nervous over my part
in private theatricals at my father&rsquo;s house in
Canterbury, I can hear him say: &ldquo;You are surely
not bothering your head about two half-pay officers
and a rural dean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And one day at a picnic, commenting on a criticism
of a sturdy Irish uncle as to &ldquo;not wanting these
slight figures at all, at all,&rdquo; Joe gave me the sound
advice not to sit upon a rock &ldquo;lest diamond cut
diamond.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We were all young then and things that may
seem truly foolish now made the company laugh;
it is more remarkable that the radiant personality,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>the inexhaustible animal spirits and rare sense of
humour should have survived years of hard work
and still have shone forth after the prostration of
illness.</p>

<p>When scarcely recovered from a serious attack,
Joe told me one morning of a dream that he had
had, which&mdash;as Mr. W. J. Locke has remarked&mdash;contained
such a &ldquo;lightning flash of characterization&rdquo;
that it is hard to believe it came to him in sleep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dreamed,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that Squire Bancroft
brought me some grapes,&rdquo; and as he removed the
paper from the basket he said, &ldquo;White, Joe;
when the case is serious I never bring black.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All through his illness, when increasing weakness
and the inconveniences arising from the Great War
forced him to an uncongenial life at sea-side resorts,
his wit still bubbled up unbidden, as the following
letter testifies. The boarding-house in which it
was written did not afford exactly sympathetic
society, yet on the Christmas Day that we spent
there he offered to give the company a little &ldquo;talk&rdquo;
if they cared to listen; and from his armchair,
he chatted for half an hour to a crowded lounge on
the eminent men whom he had known, interspersed
with many a flash of fun appropriate to the hour and
received with bursts of laughter by the simple circle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;... We are comfortable enough here,&rdquo; he
wrote to his daughter, &ldquo;and there is entertainment
furnished by some of the types, both in their
physique and in their intellectual equipment. Some
of the older females are designed and constructed
with &ldquo;dangerous salients in their lines,&rdquo; everything
occurring in unexpected places, and only dimly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
suggesting the original purpose of the Creator.
One or two are of stupendous girth with hollows
and protuberances that suggest some primeval
landscape subjected to volcanic action.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus with the same humorous and kindly eye on
the world as when he had been the welcome entertainer
of a more brilliant society, he lightened the
days&mdash;very heavy to him&mdash;of national anxiety,
and with a contentment rather wonderful in the
typical Londoner, alternated the few possible hours
of patient literary labour with a cheerful delight in
the beauties of the place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if the present difficulty in getting out
of England will make us appreciate it better,&rdquo; he
said as we stood one evening on the pier looking
towards old Hastings. &ldquo;If we were abroad we
should say that medieval castle against the sunset
was a wondrous fine sight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So did he still exemplify his life-long belief often
expressed in the words: &ldquo;How can people be dull

<p class="center">JOURNALISM AND LETTERS</p>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">My</span> husband has given some account of his days
at the Bar in his own <cite>Reminiscences</cite>. I shall,
therefore, not touch on that part of his career,
as it was practically ended before I knew him&mdash;the
necessity of earning daily grist for the mill having
carried him entirely into the ranks of journalism.</p>

<p>I believe he got through a quite unusual amount
of work in that profession. Many an evening
did I put back our little dinner while he rushed
off to Euston to give his copy of Art Criticism
for the <cite>Manchester Guardian</cite> into the hands of
the guard for early morning delivery: he wrote
on the same subject for the <cite>Pall Mall Gazette</cite>
and the <cite>Art Journal</cite>, and what with criticism
and social articles for the <cite>Saturday Review</cite>
and <cite>World</cite>, he was never in bed till long after
midnight.</p>

<p>It must have been about this time that he took
me with him to Paris for a short so-called holiday
while he wrote his criticism for the <cite>Pall Mall Gazette</cite>
on the <em>Salon</em> of the year.</p>

<p>A gladsome time it was in that most smiling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>of cities in spring. There was a day on which a
cry of dismay arose from our party&mdash;including
his fellow-worker and old friend, Adam Gielgud
with his wife&mdash;when a letter arrived from Edmund
Yates refusing to let Joe off his weekly article in
the series of Skits on the London newspapers which
were then attracting attention in the <cite>World</cite>&mdash;I
think the topic for that week was <em>The Old Maid of
Journalism</em> (&ldquo;The Spectator&rdquo;) and perhaps that
dignified lady received a more caustic drubbing
than she would otherwise have had because of the
distaste with which he set to his task.</p>

<p>Cheerful meals in the humblest of restaurants&mdash;whenever
we could run to it, in the excellent Caf&eacute;
Gaillon&mdash;now the fashionable <em>Henry</em>, but then of
far simpler ambitions; merry meetings at the
house of that good comrade of Joe&rsquo;s of whom he
tells the tale of exchanged French and English
lessons at <em>Kettner&rsquo;s</em> restaurant in London, and
lastly a gorgeous feast in the suburban home
of a fellow contributor to <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L&rsquo;Art</i>, to both of which
festivities my sister, Mrs. Harrison&mdash;then Alma
Strettell&mdash;was bidden as being of our party.</p>

<p>Both occasions were a pleasant peep into Parisian
bourgeois life. Our first host was eager to show
that he could give us a <em>gigot</em> of mutton as well
roasted as in London, and sorely crestfallen was
the poor man when the little joint came to table
black as a cinder and blue when cut. Joe quickly
made capital out of the catastrophe, however,
by declaring that one didn&rsquo;t come to Paris to eat
home fare, and that it served his friend right for
putting his cook to such an unworthy task.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>
<p>Our second entertainment, though we did not
meet such intellectual company as the distinguished
writers on the <em>Temps</em> and the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">D&eacute;bats</i>, who so courteously
helped Joe to express brilliant ideas in
daringly lame French and paid such charming
court to my sister and myself, was more typical
of its class; for, although the young couple of the
house were our entertainers, the old couple were
our hosts, and it was wondrous and delightful to
see the respectful attitude of the son and his wife
to the parents and the undisputed supremacy
which they held from their two ends of the long
table set out under the trees of the flower-laden May.</p>

<p>A rushing week it was, into which my sister
and I crammed much enthralling shopping. I can
see now Joe&rsquo;s reproachful face at the door of the
caf&eacute; where we had kept him waiting half an hour
for <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">d&eacute;jeuner</i> after his hot and tiring morning&rsquo;s
work at the <em>Salon</em>. I made a shameless excuse
to the effect that we had secured many &ldquo;occasions&rdquo;
(bargains). And as I gave him a toothbrush which
he had asked me to buy, he said: &ldquo;Is this an &lsquo;occasion&rsquo;
too? I&rsquo;d rather have a punctual meal
than an occasional toothbrush!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Merry hours but very far from idle ones, and he
reaped an additional and unexpected reward for
his labours when we got home.</p>

<p>We had been bidden to a cricket match at his
old school the day after our return, where, in virtue
of his old rank of Captain of the Eleven, he was
to play as a visitor; and I seem to see the boyish
blush of satisfaction with which he told his beloved
master&mdash;Dr. Birkbeck Hill&mdash;that it was he and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>no leader-writer on the <cite>Times</cite>, as was rumoured,
who was writing those humorous articles on the
newspapers for the <cite>World</cite>.</p>

<p>My husband has told so much of the tale of his
early journalistic days in his <cite>Eminent Victorians</cite>
that I find little to add; but I remember a curious
incident in the fine old room at Great Russell Street
when George Hake&mdash;Dante Gabriel Rossetti&rsquo;s secretary&mdash;came
one day, ostensibly &ldquo;on his own,&rdquo; to
have a talk with him on the series of papers on
painters of the day, appearing above the signature
of &ldquo;Ignotus,&rdquo; but of which the authorship had
leaked out.</p>

<p>Joe has told, in <cite>Coasting Bohemia</cite>, of the rift in
his friendship with Rossetti over these articles, and
a sad tale it is. Mr. Hake fancied that Rossetti
would like to see his friend&rsquo;s bride, but, alas! he
was taking too much on himself, for the visit never
came off. But Rossetti was at that time already
an invalid and was not to be counted upon.</p>

<p>It must have been some time after this that
the French proprietors of that luxurious publication,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L&rsquo;Art</i>, invited Joe to run a London office for its
sale, in connection with which he afterwards started
an English version&mdash;<cite>Art and Letters</cite>&mdash;edited and
largely written by himself.</p>

<p>Many funny incidents group themselves around
the person of the French proprietor, whose English,
though insistently fluent, was of the lamest, and
I think Joe sometimes led him on in the expectation
of some pleasant malapropism.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How are you now?&rdquo; he would ask, when the
poor gentleman had &ldquo;suffered the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Only &rsquo;alf and &rsquo;alf, my friend,&rdquo; the Frenchman
would reply. &ldquo;But I must back tonight. I make
my trunk at four.&rdquo; And his apt <em>mots</em> on the super-sensitive
lady-assistant who &ldquo;always begin to
tear for nothing&rdquo; and &ldquo;forgive never man that
he &rsquo;ave not married her&rdquo; afforded Joe continual
delight.</p>

<p>But a courtlier host than that Frenchman never
existed. He would entertain us royally at the
old <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Maison Dor&eacute;e</i> when we went to Paris though
he ate but little himself and always preferred the
humbler Caf&eacute; Duval; so little, in fact, was he in
accord with most men of his nation upon the food
question that, when Joe gave him the usual fish
dinner at Greenwich, he was naturally dismayed
at the explanation, after several courses had been
passed by, of &ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mon ami, je ne mange jamais du
poisson</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p><cite>Art and Letters</cite>, though an artistic was not a
financial success, but it may have led to the one
of his many adventures of which he was perhaps
the most proud: the planning and editing, at the
request of Messrs. Macmillan, of their beautiful
magazine, the <cite>English Illustrated</cite>.</p>

<p>He has spoken so well himself of his pleasant
intercourse with the men who worked for him&mdash;struggling
men in those days but known to fame
since&mdash;that there is little left for me to record,
save to note that among the many tributes from
his many friends I prize not least those of his collaborators
of that time, with the oft-repeated testimony
to his having helped them to the first-rung
on the ladder of success.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>
<p>Mr. Stanley Weyman, whose first book, <cite>The
House of the Wolf</cite>, was published in those pages,
comes first to my mind, and those who have read
my husband&rsquo;s <cite>Eminent Victorians</cite> will recollect
the striking proof of the accuracy of his critical
faculty in the incident of Mr. Weyman&rsquo;s bringing
him two letters&mdash;written with an interval of many
years&mdash;in which he criticized a play of that brilliant
novelist&rsquo;s in almost identical words, although the
first letter was written openly to the author and
the second&mdash;in forgetfulness of the fact&mdash;to a
theatrical agent who had not divulged the playwright&rsquo;s
name.</p>

<p>Robert Louis Stevenson was one of his cherished
contributors, and I recall an angry rebuke from that
great man to the Editor, who had dared to strike
out a word in the title of one of his articles at the
moment of going to press; it is pleasant to add
that a placated and highly amused reply followed
on Joe&rsquo;s deft and short method of extricating
himself from the position: &ldquo;My dear Stevenson&mdash;You
see, I knew that the extra word was a slip
of the pen,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;for I should as soon have
expected you to talk of female bitches as of male
dogs. Yours etc.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir James Barrie wrote one of his early essays
for the <cite>English Illustrated Magazine</cite>, and in
a kindred branch of the adventure&mdash;that of illustration&mdash;Mr.
Hugh Thomson was discovered
by Joe&mdash;a poor Irish lad living on the scanty pay
of advertisements for a business firm, and devoting
all his leisure to flights of fancy in the most delicate
realms of the humorous eighteenth century subjects
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>in which he has always excelled. Joe confessed
to me on the day when the boy sought an interview,
with his portfolio under his arm, that he did not
at first believe he had done the drawings himself.
But he gave him a subject, and when he returned
with it after a day or two his doubts were set
at rest, and he offered him the post which he held
for so long with distinction.</p>

<p>The relations between editor and artist were
always affectionate and I have two letters from the
latter&mdash;one to Joe and one to myself&mdash;full of a
touching gratitude such as perhaps only an Irishman
could have expressed. The one quoted below is
of later date.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="name-rr"><span class="smcap">27, Perham Road,</span></p>
<p class="name-r"><span class="smcap">West Kensington,</span></p>
<p class="date-r"><i>February 5th, 1909</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Comyns Carr</span>,</p>

<p class="indent3">It is only now that we have contrived to
get a reading of your delightful book &ldquo;Some Eminent
Victorians,&rdquo; and it has literally staggered
me (with delight) to find myself in such company.
I so rarely see a soul that I was entirely ignorant,
and never dreamt of it. We had of course read
such reviews of the book as came our way and had
rejoiced in the whole-hearted pleasure with which
the notices were charged but we never suspected
that in a corner of the book you had propped me
up. My wife is more than ever confirmed in her
opinion that you are the most delightful author
that ever lived, and she is already looking forward,
frugally, to the time when the libraries will be
selling off their soiled copies of books when she hopes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>to secure Some Eminent Victorians and ME for
her very own. Possibly you might think it forward
in me if I told you what a genuine delight
it is to read the book for the way it is written.
Your pages on Bright and the orators are as eloquent
as they. But it is all the most entertaining
book we have read for ages. Below is a memory
of the famous interview you had with the suspicious
character from Ireland. I think I have caught
the bannisters well, as also Lacour waiting outside.</p>

<p class="center">Your delighted</p>
<p class="name-r"><span class="smcap">Hugh Thomson.</span></p>
</div>

<p class="space-above2"></p>

<p>So much for the affectionate reverence in which
one held him who was starting life&rsquo;s race when that
&ldquo;famous interview&rdquo; took place. Joe was comparatively
young himself then, but as the years
went on there were many of greater disparity
in age, who did not fail to pay him the same tribute;
indeed, I don&rsquo;t think there was ever any sense
of difference in this respect between him and the
many good comrades in many classes of society
who rejoiced to <i>work</i> with him because he always
lightened labour with kindness and good humour&mdash;who
rejoiced to <i>play</i> with him because he was never
afraid of, or at a loss for, the right word at the
right moment, were it grave or gay, appreciative
or pungent as the occasion required.</p>

<p>He was always the encourager, never the discourager,
of sincere and patient effort: bombast
and a pandering to mere popularity, he could censure
with words of biting wit, but he never laughed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>at those who sent their arrows at the moon though
he knew well enough that such might not achieve
financial prosperity. His unfaltering advice was
always that everyone should stick to what he best
loved to do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; I remember his saying to me one
day, when I had tried and signally failed to write
a popular farce, &ldquo;it takes a more competent fool
than you to know just what kind of foolishness
the public wants. Don&rsquo;t you be put off what you
<i>can</i> do because you fancy it is not what they
want.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And in a letter written perhaps in a more serious
spirit to one often oppressed by a sense of failure
I find the words: &ldquo;There is no such thing as failure&mdash;excepting
the failure to see and love the beauty
of life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These are among the graver memories of him:
his generation will remember him most readily
for what Sir James Barrie, writing to me of him
as &ldquo;a man for whom I had a mighty admiration,&rdquo;
appreciatively describes as &ldquo;his positive genius for
conversation.&rdquo; The latter word is so apt because
it perceives that the Celtic gift of repartee was the
most finely pointed of his arrows: he was generally
at his best when some might have fancied that he
was going to be non-plussed.</p>

<p>One day he told me of a dinner at which
King Edward VII., then Prince of Wales, was the
honoured guest. Someone had whispered to the
Prince that my husband was a Radical, and he,
turning to him, asked if such a thing could be true.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <i>am</i> a Radical, Sir,&rdquo; replied Joe, and after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>a little pause added: &ldquo;but I never mention it in
respectable society.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The table was silent for an instant, but the Prince
led the way with a laugh and all was well.</p>

<p>A funny little incident, told me in the small
hours when Joe came home, described the dire
discomfiture of one of his greatest admirers when,
having invited him to supper that he might silence
&ldquo;a conceited young ass&rdquo; by his superior wit,
the &ldquo;conceited young ass&rdquo; so fancied himself
as to monopolize the whole conversation: this
fiasco, though not to his own glorification, caused
Joe infinite delight; but the disgusted host was
only consoled after he had arranged a duel for my
husband with Robert Marshall, the playwright,
a recognised wit&mdash;the condition being that neither
should think before speaking: I consider that
here an unfair advantage was taken&mdash;any one
who was a friend of Joe&rsquo;s knowing full well that
this was just the whip of which he loved the lash.
Be it added that this tilt between the two knights
cemented their friendship.</p>

<p>A host of these incidents took place in his well-loved
Garrick Club, of which&mdash;by the testimony
of many friends&mdash;he was the heart and soul and
some add the good genius. I believe there were
quarrels not a few that he averted or headed by
his tact and kindly humour&mdash;quarrels that might
sometimes have led to sorrowful decisions by the
Club Committee to which he belonged. He told
me one day of a humorous end to an earnest
expostulation he had held with poor Harry Kemble&mdash;greatly
beloved in spite of his known weakness:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
&ldquo;Every word you say is true, my dear Joe,&rdquo; the
actor had replied with the tears streaming down
his great cheeks&mdash;&ldquo;but what if I like it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is good to remember that that colossal figure&mdash;of
which our daughter, seeing it on the stage when
she was a child, asked tremulously, &ldquo;Is it a human
being?&rdquo;&mdash;remained to the end an honoured institution
of the Club.</p>

<p>Of Joe&rsquo;s tactful capacity as a peacemaker I
was a witness at the home of my mother&rsquo;s
family&mdash;the beautiful Gothic Abbey of Bisham
near Marlow. We were staying with my cousin,
George Vansittart, who was then the owner. He
was the kindest of men, but had a peppery and
ill-controlled temper, and nothing so inflamed it
as the growing habit with trippers on the Thames
of landing upon his grounds. His gardeners and
keepers were sternly bidden to warn off these rash
people, and he himself, if walking or shooting in
Bisham woods&mdash;quite a mile from the Abbey&mdash;would
angrily bid them begone.</p>

<p>One day he and Joe were sitting in his ground-floor
library facing the river, when he espied a boat
containing a lady and a man making across stream
towards the big trees shading his lawns. He jumped
up&mdash;his face flushed, and watched the man rise,
a powerful figure, ship his sculls and push into
shore. &ldquo;By&mdash;&mdash;, the insolent brute! Under my
very nose!&rdquo; shrieked the incensed squire. And,
seizing a heavy stick he strode out of the French
window&mdash;Joe following somewhat alarmed.</p>

<p>My cousin took no pains to soften the language
with which he addressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span> &ldquo;the insolent brute&rdquo;
before he was half-way across the lawn, and Joe
hastened as he saw the big man step defiantly out
of the boat while the woman wept and implored
him unavailingly to return. Joe caught my cousin
by the arm&mdash;he was getting on in years&mdash;for as
he drew near he saw that the intruder was an actor&mdash;of
no great refinement&mdash;known in the profession
for a swaggering bully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lady in the boat, Mr. Vansittart,&rdquo;
said my husband. Instantly my cousin stopped,
and the man, recognising Joe, greeted him surlily
and presently turned back to his companion now
fainting on the bank. Joe followed him, and George
Vansittart, returning to the house, called out to
his butler, who was hastening to the scene: &ldquo;Take
out some brandy and water for the lady and see
she needs nothing.&rdquo; Joe brought back a message
of thanks from the poor thing, and was far too
anxious lest the outbreak should affect my cousin&rsquo;s
health to mind his remark that he was to be congratulated
upon his acquaintance.</p>

<p>Recurring to that appreciation of him by the
young in his last years, which is one of the sweetest
tributes to Joe&rsquo;s memory, many alert and boyish
faces rise up before me; eager over some animated
discussion in which the give-and-take was always
even between the older man and the younger,
or alight with laughter at his quaint wit and merry
censure of some foible of the day; for though he
could laugh at its foibles he was never out of heart
with the world, which was always to him a good
world, even when he prophesied that, through <i>some</i>
crucible, the crazes of the last twenty years would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>have to pass for elimination. &ldquo;They have got
to have this epidemic,&rdquo; he would say of Cubist
painter and eccentric poet, &ldquo;but they&rsquo;ll get over
it, and meanwhile the good old world will go on
quietly as usual and young folk will fall in love
and want poets to sing for them and so the best
things must come to the top in the end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Apart from this sort of, as he called it, &ldquo;half-baked&rdquo;
thought, he was always ready to weigh
and consider every new aspect of life; and if no
passing mode could deceive him or put him out
of heart, either with his life-long heroes or with
his own methods of expression; yet to the last
hour he was always keen&mdash;not only for fresh work
himself, but to see the work of the world develop.
In the words of Mr. Stopford Brooke, quoted in
the <cite>Life</cite> by Prof. L. P. Jacks, he would have said:
&ldquo;Whether in this world or another we will pursue,
we will overtake, we will divide the spoil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so, whether he were hanging over the garden
gate of our holiday home gathering information
from the labourers who passed along the road,
or discussing ethical problems with his sons and
their friends, he was always &ldquo;pursuing&rdquo;&mdash;and the
young were always at home with him, for he never
wanted to lead only to express his opinion and listen
to their reply.</p>

<p>One of these younger men&mdash;Mr. Hammond,
by no means an &ldquo;obscure&rdquo; one&mdash;writes: &ldquo;There
have been few men whose companionship was so
delightful to all who had the privilege of knowing
him.... I always remember with gratitude that
he allowed even young and obscure people to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
enjoy the pleasure of his best conversation&mdash;one of
the rarest intellectual pleasures that I have ever
known.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Mr. Hugh Sidgwick&mdash;killed in the prime of
his own rare intellectual career&mdash;follows with what
might be called an echo: &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say how much
I owe to him and to you for the many happy hours
I spent at your house. He never let the barrier
of the generations stand between him and us young
men and we all of us looked on him as a real friend
and the most delightful of companions. There
are memories of many good talks and jovial discussions&mdash;with
Mr. Carr always leading and contributing
more than his share of life and vivacity
to them. And it was inspiring to us&mdash;more perhaps
than appeared&mdash;to meet one who was so young
in heart, so full of life and so sensitive to all the
beauties of all the arts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The words of W. A. Moore&mdash;blessed with his
own Celtic temperament and eager fighting quality&mdash;sound
the same note:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a great thing to have known him,&rdquo;
he writes from Salonica, &ldquo;I can never forget him
for he was a most radiant personality.&rdquo; It is a
curious thing that a kindred epithet&mdash;&ldquo;joyous
personality&rdquo;&mdash;was a favourite one of his own,
and he would maintain that you could see two
men in the Seven Dials&mdash;one lean, soured and
scowling, his companion stout, merry, humorous
and full of vitality, though both dwelt on the same
gutter and wore the same threadbare garments.</p>

<p>It is, of course, quite impossible to give on paper
any idea whatever of the charm and brilliancy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>which these and many more testimonies prove;
to quote some words spoken by our friend Sir
Arthur Pinero, &ldquo;It is rather like trying to remember
the summers of years ago!&rdquo; and he left so few
letters, possibly because he possessed that &ldquo;genius
of conversation,&rdquo; that he has few words to say
for himself; but it may not be inappropriate here
to quote two which he wrote to an old friend who
had affectionately watched his whole career and
highly appraised his powers and judgment.</p>

<p>The first is in answer to an appeal as to whether
it showed &ldquo;symptoms of senile decay&rdquo; not to be
able to admire <cite>The Hound of Heaven</cite> by Francis
Thompson, which had been hailed with a shout
of praise from a section of the public. I quote
it as showing Joe&rsquo;s own confession of faith in regard
to the poetry that endures.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&ldquo;My dear&mdash;The Hound is a Mongrel. I know
him of old and have more than once driven him
from my door. Several friends have endeavoured
to persuade me that he was of the true breed but I
would have none of him and will not now. Upon
the provocation of your letter I read the thing
again and most gladly and willingly share your
symptoms of senile decay. The fabric of it I take
to be pure fustian. And there is not a line in it
that does not debauch the language it employs;
not a phrase in it that does not seem to me to
vulgarize by its expression whatever innocent
thought may underlie it.</p>

<p>The more I ponder over the great verse which
time has left impregnable, the more I am impressed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
by the true poet&rsquo;s unfailing reverence for the sanctity
of words in their relation to sense and by his stern
rejection of all melody that is not rooted there:
the tinkling cadence of an obvious tune is not
for him. His purpose might be taken to be no
other than to express in final simplicity the thought
that is in him. Why it is, or how it is, that
in this process he achieves a result, in which the
sense of beauty banishes all remembrance of
intellectual origin&mdash;that is the poet&rsquo;s secret: the
mystery and the mastery of his craft.</p>

<p>But I am getting into depths that cannot be
plumbed on this tiny sheet of paper. It is the old
subject of many a long night&rsquo;s talk with you and
concerns matters in which I think you and I are
of accord....</p>

<p>As to Electra (Richard Strauss&rsquo; opera) of course
I have no right to plead before that tribunal;
but the terms in which it is praised make me suspect
it is not praiseworthy.</p>

<p class="center">Yours ever,</p>
<p class="name-r"><span class="smcap">J. W. Comyns Carr.&rdquo;</span></p>
</div>

<p class="space-above2"></p>

<p>In relation to the above I cannot refrain from
quoting an appreciation of my husband written
some little while later by the late Theodore Watts
Dunton. He had asked for news of his old friend
after his first serious illness, and the following passage
occurs in his acknowledgment of the reply:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Although he belongs to a later generation than
mine, he and I are as intimate as brothers and
I deeply prize the intimacy. There is no man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
on this earth whom I love more. Moreover I
have always asserted that he is a man of genius&mdash;a
true poet, with wings clipped, for the present,
by the conditions of life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As his intimates know, Charles Dickens was one
of the brightest stars in my husband&rsquo;s firmament.
During all the years of our marriage, I never remember
him without a volume of Dickens and
one of Boswell&rsquo;s <cite>Life of Johnson</cite> beside his bed.
Many a &ldquo;night&rsquo;s talk&rdquo; with the life-long friend
to whom he wrote as above had been devoted
to ineffectual attempts to converting him to a real
appreciation of Dickens&mdash;attempts which, as the
following letters show, were finally successful.</p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="smcap">&ldquo;My Dear,&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>I am very much interested in your letter
about Dickens.... [This was in the early stage of
conversion.] Curiously enough I have lately
been reading the whole of Macready&rsquo;s Diary and
was immensely interested in it. His conceit of
course is colossal, but the diary struck me as affording
a revelation of a real and virile creature of
great independence of character, gifted on occasion
with striking insight and vision. I was noticing
as I read that Dickens was the only one of all his
friends of long date with whom he never quarrelled,
and it struck me that there must have been something
innately fine and magnanimous in Dickens&rsquo;
nature to command this constancy of friendship
from a man so vain and irascible as Macready.</p>

<p>But Macready sometimes sees far and I think
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
his understanding of Browning and his appreciation
of the poet&rsquo;s inherent limitations in the field
of drama are very illuminating. Evidently the
drama was the goal of Browning&rsquo;s ambition and
yet it has always seemed to me&mdash;as it appeared
to Macready&mdash;that he was not in essence a dramatist
at all.</p>

<p>When you next come to London you should
look in at the Grafton Gallery and take a glance
at the Post Impressionists. I saw most of them
in Paris, with something added of further extravagance
and crude indecency; but the Parisian
critics, with few exceptions, took small account
of the matter. Here, on the contrary, nearly all
the younger critics are at their feet. It seems to
me to indicate a wave of disease, even of absolute
madness; for the whole product seems to breathe
not ineptitude merely but corruption&mdash;especially
marked in a sort of combined endeavour to degrade
and discredit all forms of feminine beauty.</p>

<p class="center">Yours ever,</p>
<p class="name-r"><span class="smcap">Joe.&rdquo;</span></p>
</div>

<p class="space-above2"></p>

<p>Later this was his great indictment of the Cubists
also, well known to his friends in the Club.</p>

<p>The following letter is to the same correspondent
written during the last year of his life and in much
more satisfied mood on the subject of his hero.</p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="date-r"><span class="smcap">Hastings, 1915.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">&ldquo;My Dear,&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>It gave me delight to get your letter&mdash;the
greater in that you talk to me of Dickens.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
I never tire of him nor of talking of him. But
I was not unprepared for your enthusiasm. I
remember only the last time we touched on the
topic it was already brewing. I am struck above
all by what you feel about the composer&rsquo;s gift
in him, that unconscious power of massing and
moulding his material, the instructive adjustment
of varying currents in the narrative, so that&mdash;as
he traces the courses in which they run, we recognise
in wonderment that they are confluent
streams though often seeming for the time to flow
so far asunder. Even the most modest of us are,
I think, sometimes aware that there is a force
outside ourselves which holds the reins of our
fancy and that we must needs obey; but the
exercise of that faculty in Dickens approaches
the miraculous. At times it would almost seem
as if he threw down the gauntlet to himself, directly
challenging his own powers of artistic control by
flinging at his own feet the unsifted harvest of
the most prodigal invention with which man was
ever endowed and defying the artist in him to reduce
it to order and harmony.</p>

<p>And yet the artist invariably wins and by a
victory so complete as to cheat us into the belief
that every obstacle he subdues was an integral
feature of the original design. Inexhaustible invention
and unfailing control, these are the things
that always seem to me to set Dickens on an eminence
which he shares with no one in his own time and
with only a few in our creative literature of any
time. Shakespeare stands there&mdash;as he stands
everywhere, no matter what the quality to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
appraised or what the arena in which it finds exercise,
above all rivalry; and Walter Scott most surely
and securely too; and ... well, I don&rsquo;t feel able
to be certain about any others!...</p>

<p>I am not disposed to quarrel about <cite>Bleak
House</cite>, I do not like it; but that story and <cite>Little
Dorrit</cite> have always been my stumbling blocks.</p>

<p>On the other hand I heartily agree about
<cite>Our Mutual Friend</cite>; I think it illustrates a giant&rsquo;s
way with Nature which becomes a fawning slave
before the tyranny of genius.</p>

<p class="center">Yours ever,</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="center">BOOKS AND TRAVEL</p>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Of</span> work in volume form my husband left comparatively
little, and all the books of his earlier
years were on Art. His criticisms on the various
exhibitions of Old Masters at Burlington House,
chiefly written at that time for the <cite>Pall Mall
Gazette</cite> and the <cite>Art Journal</cite>, were useful to him
in a volume on <cite>The Drawings of the Old Masters</cite>
in the British Museum, upon which subject he
was a careful and enthusiastic student; and at
a somewhat later period&mdash;when he and Mr. C. E.
Hall&eacute; organized the famous exhibitions of those
drawings at the Grosvenor Gallery&mdash;a recognised
connoisseur.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that much of the matter
written in those early years upon a subject on which
he was always a master was echoed involuntarily
in my husband&rsquo;s swan-song upon the same subject,
i.e. <cite>The Ideals of Painting</cite>, posthumously published
in 1917; for although he naturally acquired a
deeper knowledge of individual pictures as the
years went on, bringing him opportunities of visiting
the great collections of Europe, he very rarely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>changed his opinion of the characteristics of each
painter; and his loving appreciation of the subtlest
qualities in his favourites was such that I remember
a gifted connoisseur saying to him once respecting
a fellow art critic: &ldquo;So-and-so could tell you
whether a picture was authentic or not with his
back to it, provided he had got its pedigree at
his fingers ends; but you don&rsquo;t depend on books;
you know the man and his method and study
the painter in the light of them, and if your verdict
is sometimes at variance with the alleged pedigree,
by Jove, you&rsquo;re generally right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So thoroughly had he steeped himself in the
subject that when we went on our belated honeymoon
to the towns of Northern Italy, he always
knew exactly where every picture was that he wanted
to see, and many is the argument that I had in
those less enlightened days with Italian officials
as to the existence of some particular work of Art
which they little knew was under their care, and
many lovely things we found in private places
which, perhaps even now, are missed by the ordinary
tourist.</p>

<p>I recollect the weary trip he made from Milan
that he might study the wonderful Luini frescoes
at Saronno. Now the little town is on a railway,
but in those days it was only reached in a horse-omnibus,
slowly jogging, as only the poor starved
Italian horses of that day <i>could</i> jog, across the
sun-baked Lombard plains. The beautiful lunar
frescoes, some of them in sepia, in the sacristy of
the Church of San Maurizio Maggiore at Milan,
were among the things which we should never have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>seen if he had not made me insist on the sacristan
opening that closed door that he might examine
for himself. And a really funny incident occurred
at Mantova&mdash;a town lying off the regular route,
but so picturesque, with its lovely Palazzo del T&euml;
raised on arcades built into the marshes&mdash;that it
is strange it should not be oftener visited by the
tourist.</p>

<p>We lodged in a vast but dirty old Inn, waited
on by a girl whose beauty compensated, in <em>Joe&rsquo;s</em>
eyes only, for slipshod methods; nothing but my
knowledge of the tongue would have procured
us even the comfort of a huge warming-pan with
which I endeavoured to dry the damp sheets.
After a sleepless night and a tiring morning in the
Castle looking at the Mantegna portraits of grim
Gonzagas and stooping to enter the &ldquo;dwarf&rsquo;s
apartments,&rdquo; whence slits of windows peer upon
the eerie marshland, I was in no mood for an altercation.
Yet an altercation was the only means by
which I finally succeeded in inducing the morose
custodian of a dark church in the town to do Joe&rsquo;s
will: he had come to Mantova to see examples
of Mantegna for some work that he was doing
and he was not going away without having unearthed
this specially interesting one. He led the way
himself to the side-chapel where he believed the
painting to be, but lo! a hideous modern daub
hung over the little altar and his face fell. Then
he had an inspiration: in spite of the man&rsquo;s remonstrances
he went up the steps and peered behind
the gaudy painting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell him I&rsquo;ll pay him to help me get this thing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
down,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;I believe what I want is at the
back of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then my altercation began.</p>

<p>We were mad English, and one couldn&rsquo;t behave
in a Church as if it were a shop.</p>

<p>But &ldquo;mad English&rdquo; or not we were also &ldquo;rich
English&rdquo; (in the custodian&rsquo;s eyes), and a very little
English gold won the day: we saw the picture
we wanted.</p>

<p>These were only a few instances of the &ldquo;tonic
of a young man&rsquo;s conceit and obstinacy&rdquo;&mdash;to use
Joe&rsquo;s own chaff of himself&mdash;in that never-to-be-forgotten
journey through the highways and by-ways
of Northern Italy. Everything was grist
that came to his mill in this as in each separate
field of his activities; but Florence was the real
goal of all his desires, and this first visit to it, close
on the study which had made him long to see for
himself the Masters whom he loved and the fairest
of towns which was their home, had a glamour
which was never quite reached in later visits.
I can see again the poor <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Trattor&igrave;a della Luna</i> where
we lodged and the handsome waiter whom we,
in the wild enthusiasm of the hour, persuaded to
follow us to England. That he ever arrived at
all was the marvel. He might well have spent the
journey-money given him on pastimes suggested
by his reproach to me in London afterwards as
to engaging a cook who remembered the birth of
Christ: that he arrived weeping in a November
fog and bitterly resenting having been left to come
&ldquo;by sea when we had come by land,&rdquo; was not wonderful.
Joe was patient with him for my sake and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>many a funny tale did he forge out of the Italian&rsquo;s
vagaries.</p>

<p>But when this unkempt Adonis had demoralized
our maid, smashed our pretty wedding gifts in
fits of gloom, during which he would shake his
fist at the fog and say: &ldquo;Goo&rsquo; nigh&rsquo;,&rdquo; and finally
taunted us with not providing sufficient wine at
a humble entertainment to excuse one of the guests
for having left his hat behind, we felt it best he
should return to his native land&mdash;though not before
he had inadvertently half poisoned us with dried
mushrooms sent by his relatives.</p>

<p>Well, badly as Mario behaved subsequently
in Great Russell Street he was one of the features
of our happy Florence holiday and directed our
steps towards many out-of-the-way places which
Joe thirsted to explore in search of Art treasures
unknown to guide-books.</p>

<p>My husband&rsquo;s knowledge culled from many
old books was of great value to him, and with
his bump of locality, joined to my knowledge of
the speech of the people, we penetrated into many
lovely corners and met with as many amusing
adventures.</p>

<p>Strange food did we eat too on that weird trip,
for here, as elsewhere, Joe insisted on exploring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell him I&rsquo;m a judge of the <em>cuisine</em>,&rdquo; he would
say, &ldquo;and only want the best.&rdquo; And&mdash;with an
instinct that the rewarding tip would not be wanting&mdash;as
it never was&mdash;cooks hastened to concoct
the spiciest of their national dishes for his criticism.</p>

<p>The publication of Joe&rsquo;s first book was quickly
followed by an illustrated volume on the Abbey
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>Church of St. Albans from articles written for the
<cite>Art Journal</cite>; plenty of study on architecture and
on monkish lore was done for this in the Reading
Room of the British Museum. Later in life Joe
used to say that, after the period of ravenous and
enthusiastic boyhood, he might never have opened
a serious book again&mdash;so much more enthralling
to him was the daily intercourse for work or play
with living men and women&mdash;had it not been for
the necessity of boiling the pot; and that all that
he read for a special purpose stuck to him as no
desultory reading did and became stored in his
mind for use and pleasure for the rest of his life.</p>

<p>I can see myself how true this was in respect
of the whole range of Arthurian legend, on which
subject he became an authority; he devoured
everything in English and French that he could
find when he was writing his plays of <cite>King Arthur</cite>
and <cite>Tristram</cite>, and never forgot any of it.</p>

<p>The <em>Abbey of St. Albans</em> was too special a subject
to make a popular book, and the first volume of
Joe&rsquo;s work which attracted attention was <cite>Essays
on Art</cite>, gathered together in 1879.</p>

<p>I remember that, just as among his published
work in verse he held that his <cite>Tristram and
Iseult</cite> was his best, so he considered the Essay&mdash;practically
on Keats, who held, I think, the highest
place with him among the nineteenth century poets
but entitled <cite>The Artistic Spirit in Modern English
Poetry</cite>, he judged to be among his most satisfactory
prose; with the exception of the <cite>Essay on Macbeth</cite>,
written as a pamphlet at the time of Henry Irving&rsquo;s
production of the play, and now re-published under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>the title of <cite>Sex in Tragedy</cite> in his book <cite>Coasting
Bohemia</cite>.</p>

<p>A letter which he wrote me later from France,
when he was studying the provincial museums there
for a series of articles in the <cite>Manchester Guardian</cite>,
bears out pleasantly the criticism in the article
on <cite>Corot and Millet</cite> in <cite>Essays on Art</cite>.</p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="name-rr"><span class="smcap">Limoges,</span></p>
<p class="date-r"><i>August 1882</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;... The landscape of the Loire somewhat
disappointed me, although the towns are full of
interest. Very fruitful the country seems to be,
overflowing with corn and vine but far stretching
and unvaried with a vague sense of melancholy in
it that is almost oppressive. It is impossible to
catch even a passing view of such country as lies
between Orl&eacute;ans and Nantes without turning in
thought from the landscape to the people who
dwell in it; and the picture that is left in the mind
of the daily life of these peasants who labour all
day in fields that have no break or limit save where
patches of corn alternate with spaces of vine, is
strangely touching and sad. It wanted a France
such as France is on the borders of the Loire to
produce the solemn and austere sentiment of
Millet, and I hardly think one understands the stern
reality of his work until one has passed through
miles and miles of this fruitful and uneventful
land.</p>

<p>The later passages of to-day&rsquo;s journey were a
delightful change in the character of the scenery;
a narrower river (The Vienne) but more sympathetic,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
with happy-looking green pastures and hilly
banks.</p>

<p>This place stands high and the air is delightfully
fresh. It has an industrial museum which is
important in connection with my work.</p>

<p>I visited Chambord also Chenonceau. They are
both much restored and inferior in interest to Blois,
which is a most delightful place in every way.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>In respect of Blois he writes as follows in another
letter: &ldquo;This town is more picturesque than any
French town I have yet seen; most of it, or the
older part of it at any rate, is high up on a hill, and
the steps that mount up between the different
streets are very beautifully contrived.</p>

<p>Tell Phil I should like him to read the parts
of his French history connected with Blois, particularly
about Henri III. and the Duke of Guise,
and I will tell him about the wonderful castle when
I get back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I remember he brought home some excellent
photographs of that castle and the lovely outer
staircase of the tower.</p>

<p>Another letter written during this French journey
brings in a more humorous note: &ldquo;Toulouse is a
real city of the south, its market place covered with
big red umbrellas reminding one of Verona, and the
old hotel having a pleasant shady courtyard with
pots of oleanders.... It is difficult to give you
much news. I was thinking this morning how
funny it was how little I had spoken English since
I left home, once with the manager of a travelling
English panorama at Limoges and yesterday at
Montauban where I met a Frenchman who insisted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
upon speaking my native tongue to me. He declared
that he knew English &lsquo;au fond,&rsquo; but his mastery
of the tongue was not complete. &lsquo;Good voyage,
have distraction,&rsquo; were his parting words to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These good wishes were not entirely fulfilled.
The day after his arrival at Toulouse Joe had been
overcome by the August heat and mosquito bites,
and had been obliged to take to his bed for a day
in the fine old inn, where he was admirably nursed
by the motherly landlady; and, as he sat in the
cool courtyard next day he was vastly amused by
the discomfiture of a fat commercial traveller,
awaiting his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">d&eacute;jeuner</i> with napkin tucked in ready
under his chin, when a one-legged old stork, who
perambulated the garden, suddenly uttered its
raucous note: &ldquo;Quel cri &eacute;pouvantable!&rdquo; exclaimed
the poor gentleman, and jumping up he overturned
the small table on which a succulent Southern dish
now steamed ready for his consumption, and wept
afresh at the sight of gravy and red wine trickling
together down the coarse clean tablecloth!</p>

<p>I think merriment must have hampered Joe&rsquo;s
offers of assistance, and his French was not then as
fluent as he made it in after years.</p>

<p>Anyhow the commercial traveller appears to
have been less genial than was a gentleman in the
train later on who thought to flatter him by comparing
him to the then Prince of Wales: &ldquo;Les
m&ecirc;mes traits, la m&ecirc;me barbe, le m&ecirc;me &acirc;ge!&rdquo; said
he pleasantly, not thinking that he was speaking to
a man years younger than Edward VII.</p>

<p>But if there was a momentary annoyance it was
immediately forgotten by Joe in a lively, if halting,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>conversation on the merits of a trout stream which
the train was skirting&mdash;Joe vehemently describing
how different was our view regarding poachers
with the net, and mentally despising his fellow-traveller
for upholding the equal merits of perch,
gudgeon and trout.</p>

<p>When they reached Lourdes the traveller again
afforded Joe a fresh cause for wonder&mdash;unfamiliar
as he then was with what later he called &ldquo;the
Frenchman&rsquo;s unfailing desire to place himself in a
category.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The station was crammed with pilgrims to the
Holy Wells, and Joe, innocent of this, asked
for what event the crowd was gathered; whereupon
the Frenchman, turning his head contemptuously
from the window, said loftily: &ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur, dans
ma qualit&eacute; d&rsquo;Ath&eacute;e je ne connais rien de tout
cela!</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even in those early days he loved the French;
their joy of living appealed to him as it did in all the
Latin races, and their wit&mdash;more subtle and polished
than the Italian&rsquo;s child-like though not childish
high spirits&mdash;was akin to his own, and it was often
wonderful how swiftly he would &ldquo;get the hang of
it&rdquo; even when sometimes he would appeal to me
for translation of a word; while their shrewd and
clear common-sense found an echo somewhere
on another side of him, perhaps in his Border
ancestry.</p>

<p>Yet I have heard him say that, in his opinion,
the deeper courtesy of an unspoiled Italian&mdash;were
he peasant or peer&mdash;came out of a further and finer
civilization.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>
<p>These travelling conversations, even in a foreign
tongue, were entirely in keeping with Joe&rsquo;s intensely
human temperament. He had none of the aloofness
of the Britisher of that day; and I remember his
amusement at the talk of a party of English shop-keepers
in a second-class railway carriage on the
Paris-Calais route.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To see them working men forced to sit and smoke
their pipe in the street for a breath of fresh air on
a summer evening fairly flummoxed me,&rdquo; said one.
&ldquo;Why the poorest of <i>us</i> &rsquo;ave got a bit of a backyard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Though he was the most reserved of men as
regards deep, personal matters, he found that sort
of sentiment was utterly ridiculous to his Irish
sense of humour.</p>

<p>I recollect hearing Joe whimsically tell a friend
once that he would far sooner confide his most
intimate concerns to a man in a train than to his
nearest and dearest; and then he would recall
(or invent?) the most humorous conversations which
he had overheard or in which he had taken part,
chiefly on the physical ills of life during long journeys
in dark railway carriages. I don&rsquo;t suppose he went
these lengths in French; probably his vocabulary
was not equal to it.</p>

<p>He said he missed my help on that Loire journey
although I think he liked learning for himself too.
I certainly, sitting in a tiny cottage near Witley
with my sister and the two children, missed my
opportunity and sighed to be with him, especially
when his letter home contained a passage like this:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Marseilles is a city with something of romantic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
suggestion about it. One feels that it is one of the
Avenues of the East, one of the places also that
connects the old world with the new. It was
terribly hot, but the sea tempered the sun and the
sea-bath in the evening was a delicious revenge for
the heat of the day. The view over the Mediterranean
at sunset is delightful, with an atmosphere
that seems to be stained with rose colour floating
over a sea of real aquamarine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had to solace myself with taking Phil to sit for
his portrait to Edward Burne-Jones&mdash;delightful
occasions when that most lovable of great men
would talk of my husband and of their kindred
enthusiasms, chaffing me gently as well for the
&ldquo;wicked travesties&rdquo; of classic myths with which
I tried to keep quiet the &ldquo;worst of little sitters,&rdquo; who
would innocently ask why his standing pose was
called &ldquo;sitting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And at last Joe came home, only about a week
before our son Arthur was born.</p>

<p>These travelling memories are a digression induced
by their bearing on my husband&rsquo;s first published
volumes. As to his subsequent contributions to
permanent literature I may mention his <cite>Papers
on Art</cite>&mdash;a sequel to the <cite>Essays on Art</cite>&mdash;published
in 1885.</p>

<p>After that, until the last years of his life, his many
vocations so entirely filled every hour of the day&mdash;and
often of the night&mdash;that he had no leisure
for any more such ventures, excepting the publication
of his verse-plays as they appeared on the
stage.</p>

<p>And it was not until 1908 that he once more came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
before the book-reading public. Then he wrote
his two separate volumes of personal recollections
under the titles of <cite>Eminent Victorians</cite> and <cite>Coasting
Bohemia</cite>; but these are of recent enough date to
need no comment of mine, for they are still before
the world, as is also his posthumously published
volume, <cite>The Ideals of Painting</cite>.</p>

was fixed and led later to the long co-operation of
these two friends in their New Gallery Exhibitions.</p>

<p>Sir Coutts&rsquo;s venture was to start in the following
May, and there was much to discuss and settle at
that shooting party; yet not so much as to interfere
with plenty of fun by the way.</p>

<p>It was on this visit that Prince Leopold was
a guest at the house and I vividly recall a series
of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tableaux vivants</i> got up for his entertainment,
in which Joe played a part he was often to fill later&mdash;that
of stage manager, combined on this occasion
with the office of <em>Dresser</em>, in which capacity he
&ldquo;corked&rdquo; a moustache on His Royal Highness&rsquo;
face for an impersonation of Charles I.</p>

<p>There were anxious moments&mdash;such as when the
Prince&rsquo;s tights did not arrive from Edinburgh,
or when Sir Arthur Sullivan, after nobly seconding
Joe&rsquo;s efforts with his incidental music, flatly refused
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>to abandon his cigar at a late hour to play waltzes;
or again, on the following Sunday morning when&mdash;the
crimson cloth being laid ready at the Episcopalian
Church&mdash;a belated telegram arrived from
Windsor commanding H.R.H.&rsquo;s attendance at
Presbyterian worship. But I think Joe&rsquo;s unconventional
and merry wit&mdash;even in those early days
when he might have felt strange in that kind of
society&mdash;helped away many a little ruction, and the
fun that he made of himself as &ldquo;one of the lower
middle class&rdquo; little used to the ways of great houses
was much appreciated by Arthur Sullivan, &ldquo;Dicky
Doyle&rdquo; and others claiming kinship with the
&ldquo;Bohemians,&rdquo; yet used to the habits at which he
pretended to be alarmed.</p>

<p>I can see the twinkle in the eye with which he
stoutly declared that a French Chef did not necessarily
beget a sure taste in the hosts, and the
corroboration given to his statement by the sight of
some twenty docile people eating a salad that had
been mixed with methylated spirit in mistake for
vinegar without turning a hair.</p>

<p>I think Arthur Sullivan&mdash;who was an <em>habitu&eacute;</em>&mdash;expostulated
with the butler about it, when the
cause of the &ldquo;odd taste&rdquo; was run to earth and laid
to the account of the kitchenmaid.</p>

<p>These Balcarres days began for us that series of
social gatherings so well known later as the Grosvenor
Gallery Sunday afternoons, at which Lady Lindsay
presided over a company including all the most
notable people in Literature and Art, to say nothing
of the &ldquo;beaux noms,&rdquo; courtiers and politicians in
her more exclusive set.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>
<p>Those most entertaining parties and the Private
Views both at the Grosvenor Gallery and, later on,
at the New Gallery in Regent Street, were among the
season&rsquo;s features of that period, and invitations to
both of them were eagerly sought by all classes of
Society. Especially in the earlier years the vagaries
in dress assumed by some of the women of the
&ldquo;Artistic&rdquo; and Theatrical Set were, and I fear often
justly, matters for merriment to those of the fashionable
world who fitly displayed the last modes from
Paris; and I hear again the softly sarcastic tones of a
society lady commenting on the clinging draperies
of a pretty artist &ldquo;finished by a pair of serviceable
boots.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yet there were those among the leaders of the
<em>&eacute;lite</em> who chose to wear garments following the
simpler and more graceful patterns of some bygone
era; and I am bound to say that these were often
among the most beautiful toilettes present and
those which Joe then most admired.</p>

<p>But much strenuous work preceded the days of
the Private Views. Early in the career of the
Grosvenor Gallery, Joe, steeped in the work of the
Old Masters of which he had made such a special
study, persuaded Sir Coutts Lindsay to have an
exhibition of their drawings&mdash;culled from the
great collections of England; and many a pleasant
visit did he have to fine country houses on this
quest.</p>

<p>Once he arrived after a night journey at the seat
of Lord Warwick just as the men of the house-party
were met in the hall for the day&rsquo;s &ldquo;shoot,&rdquo;
and I can fancy the merry excuse with which he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
surely fitted the occasion as he presented himself
bare-headed, having left his hat in the train when
he sleepily changed carriages at the junction;
luckily he was well provided with natural covering.</p>

<p>Plenty of his Celtic persuasiveness must have
come into play&mdash;both on this occasion and on those
when the fine shows of Paintings by Old Masters
were made&mdash;in cajoling the owners to lend their
priceless treasures, and I recollect one or two very
anxious moments over transport, etc.</p>

<p>But this first ambitious Exhibition of <cite>Drawings</cite>
exceeded, both in bulk and excellence, anything
previously attempted in London and attracted the
enthusiastic attention of all connoisseurs; the
hanging and cataloguing involved immense labour,
and I was proud to be allowed to take a small share
in the last part of the work&mdash;an opportunity in
which I learnt much which I have never forgotten.</p>

<p>When, some few years later, my husband and
Mr. Hall&eacute; started their independent enterprise in
Regent Street, their sole responsibility made the
work none the less arduous though naturally less
hampered.</p>

<p>The first task&mdash;exciting as it was&mdash;was a Herculean
one, for the New Gallery was practically built upon
the site of an old fruit-market, and an anxious winter
was that, lest it should not be completed in time for
an opening with the other May Exhibitions. But
completed it was and handsomely; though the
last touch, the gilding of the rails of the gallery
which overhung the Central Court, was only finished
through Joe inducing the frame-gilders to work
with the builders&rsquo; men&mdash;an infringement of custom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>which, it seemed, only the affection which they bore
him induced them to overlook.</p>

<p>The effect of that Central Court with its fountain
fringed with flowers and its arcade panelled with
fine, coloured marbles, was one of the sensations of
the day, and deserved the praise of a critic: &ldquo;It
is an Aladdin&rsquo;s Palace sprung up in the night.&rdquo;
Joe has spoken of this first Exhibition in <cite>Eminent
Victorians</cite>; suffice it, therefore, to say that the
Burne Jones and Watts&rsquo; pictures were the distinguishing
features, as they always were so long
as these great men survived.</p>

<p>As years went on, the collecting of works among
the lesser artists for the modern yearly Exhibition
became more and more irksome to Joe, and the
rounds that he and Mr. Hall&eacute; used to make to the
artists&rsquo; studios were something of a penance to
him.</p>

<p>Not only were they physically fatiguing, but the
difficulties of choice, of obtaining what they desired
and of refusing what they didn&rsquo;t desire without
undue offence to the artist, taxed the patience of
both directors and, I think, Joe&rsquo;s wit was often
needed to turn a dangerous corner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good isn&rsquo;t the word,&rdquo; he once answered to a
sympathiser who asked him what he said when
confronted with a thoroughly bad picture; and,
although this too transparent form of salve may
not really have been uttered, I am told that the
kindly chaff which he would sometimes expend upon
the shameless offer of a poor painting from a man
who knew what he was doing but meant to send
his best work to take its chance elsewhere, was such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>as might not have &ldquo;gone down&rdquo; from anyone
else but Joe Carr.</p>

<p>Yet there were pleasant hours even on these days
of weary rounds. In each of the districts visited
the directors were sure to count at least one firm
friend, anxious to lighten the road; in Kensington
it was Burne Jones, who, speaking of his young
daughter, wrote on one occasion: &ldquo;In my wife&rsquo;s
absence, Margaret dispenses middle-class hospitality
with a tact and finish worthy of a higher sphere.&rdquo;
In St. John&rsquo;s Wood it was Alma Tadema&mdash;most
hospitable of hosts&mdash;always ready with a bottle
of his best wine and some funny tale uttered in his
quaint English, and admirably seconded by his
charming wife at the long, narrow table loaded with
old Dutch silver and lovely curios.</p>

<p>And upon the onerous occasions of the varnishing
days when the positions on the line were supposed
to be the right of every exhibitor, these and
other leaders in the world of art would often &ldquo;stand
by&rdquo; even when some incensed young gentleman&mdash;these
were usually young gentlemen&mdash;would go the
length of removing his picture in a four-wheeler.</p>

<p>Many were the humorous incidents that used to
be told to me! A favourite and out-spoken assistant
was once asked what he thought of the position of
a small picture which was being tried above a
larger one; to which his reply was: &ldquo;If you ask
me, Sir, I think it looks like a tom-tit on a round of
beef.&rdquo; Apparently the directors thought so too
for the picture was removed and hung in a corner,
or perhaps in the balcony above the Central Court&mdash;a
place even less coveted by the ambitious.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>
<p>Little however did <i>I</i> know of these prickly passages,
specially at that momentous first opening,
when a kind supporter of the new enterprise presented
me with a beautiful old brocade dress in
which I took my share of receiving the crowds of
visitors at the entrance of the Hall: and I don&rsquo;t
think that, when the varnishing day was past, the
two directors bothered their heads much about the
prickly passages or even about the Press opinions.
Joe&rsquo;s optimism was always irrepressible and when
his task at the New Gallery was over, he would turn,
on the following day&mdash;with something perhaps of
relief&mdash;to one of the many other sides of his full life.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="center">DRAMATIC WORK AND MANAGEMENT</p>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> must have been somewhere about this period
that the first impetus was, funnily enough, given
to Joe&rsquo;s dramatic career by a request from our dear
friend, Ellen Terry, that I should make an English
adaptation for her from the famous French play of
<cite>Frou-Frou</cite>.</p>

<p>The thing was done, and played in Glasgow and
other Northern towns under the title of <cite>Butterfly</cite>,
and great fun we had over our first initiation into the
mysteries of dress-rehearsals&mdash;not always perhaps
quite so funny in the more responsible circumstances
of later years, though it is a form of patient work
electrified by the gambling spirit, which never lost
its attraction for Joe.</p>

<p>My altered version of the French play was a poor
one, but it had, I suppose, sufficient merit to obtain
me a commission from Mme. Modjeska, the noted
Polish actress, for a free translation of the same play,
which she performed first in London with Sir
Johnston Forbes-Robertson and afterwards throughout
the United States.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;youthful conceit&rdquo; to which Joe was
throughout his life so lenient as even to consider a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>virtue, led me presently to try my hand at a bigger
task&mdash;no less than the dramatisation of Thomas
Hardy&rsquo;s <cite>Far from the Madding Crowd</cite>. I was quite
unequal to the attempt, and I only mention it
because it proved the beginning of Joe&rsquo;s dramatic
work. He took the play in hand, refashioned the
plot, only keeping portions of the dialogue as I had
adapted it to stage necessity; and it was produced&mdash;with
Marion Terry as the wilful and charming
Bathsheba&mdash;first in the provinces and then in London.</p>

<p>Owing to circumstances needless to recall, the
venture was a financial failure; but it served to
start Joe on a new road; and it was not long before
he scored a big success. He came home one night
from a railway journey and gave me a little book
which he had bought to read in the train: it was
<cite>Called Back</cite> by Hugh Conway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See if you don&rsquo;t think that an enthralling story?&rdquo;
he said.</p>

<p>There could be no doubt of this and the British
public gave its verdict promptly. The book began
to sell like &ldquo;hot cakes&rdquo; and Joe went down to
Clifton, saw its clever author&mdash;until then unknown
to literature&mdash;and arranged with him for its dramatisation.</p>

<p>The play was produced on May 20th, 1884, and I
think there are still people who remember its first
success and that, in the r&ocirc;le of the Italian conspirator&mdash;Macari&mdash;Sir
Herbert Tree scored one of his
finest early triumphs; the piece was revived several
times in London and the provinces and had the
questionable compliment of being also pirated. But
I shall not easily forget the dress-rehearsal!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>
<p>I was comparatively new to such things then and
I can well recall the chill of heart with which we got
home to Blandford Square in the early hours and my
inner conviction that the scenery could not possibly
be finished nor, one at least, of the principal actors,
know his part by the next night! But nothing
could ever quell Joe&rsquo;s hopeful spirit; he plied his
somewhat less optimistic colleague with cold tongue
and whisky-and-soda and made merry work of the
stupidity of lime-light men and scene-shifters, to
say nothing of others of higher degree; and then
went to sleep at 6 a.m. and got up and returned to
the theatre at 10 a.m. without turning a hair.</p>

<p>I wonder now if he was as strong as he seemed in
those days or whether it was only his gay and
excitable Celtic temperament that carried him
through everything. Anyhow he enjoyed his life
to the full and there were never any dull moments,
whether he was at work or at play.</p>

<p>The radiant vitality which lasted him so long and
so well&mdash;and to which there is such frequent testimony
in letters from the various friends with whom
he laboured in his many walks of life&mdash;seems to
have had the power of so communicating itself to
his fellow-workers that they would share his optimistic
hopes and, if these were disappointed, generally
be ashamed to utter reproach in the face of his
urbane acceptance of failure. But on this occasion
there was only rejoicing.</p>

<p>In a letter of his, replying to Hugh Conway&rsquo;s
generous recognition of help, I find these words:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to tell you how much touched I have
been by your letters. I say &lsquo;letters&rsquo; for my wife
read me as much of your note as she thought good for
me. Rest assured that I am delighted to have done
what I have done&mdash;also that the result has been
fortunate for us both. I don&rsquo;t think I could have
got through so well with any other man; with you
I have never had a shadow of worry or annoyance
and I have been able at all points to do my best&mdash;as
far as I knew how.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This happy venture led to a friendship which had
no let until the untimely death of Hugh Conway
in the very zenith of his fame; they were, as dear
old Sir Alma Tadema said in his quaint English:
&ldquo;Very fat together&mdash;like two hands on one stomach.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yet they did much work together, for not only
did Joe collaborate again with Hugh Conway in
the adaptation of <cite>Dark Days</cite> for the stage, but he
also published that gifted, ghoulish tale <cite>Paul Vargus</cite>
during his editorship of <cite>The English Illustrated
Magazine</cite>, as well as the serial entitled <cite>A Family
Affair</cite>, a humorous and urbane story with a plot
so delicately suggesting possible immorality, however,
that it drew down upon the editor a sharp
reproach from Mrs. Grundy, who declared that,
although she believed all would &ldquo;come right&rdquo; she
could never again allow the magazine to lie on
her drawing-room table lest her well-brought-up
daughters might open its pages.</p>

<p>Does that Mrs. Grundy still live to-day?</p>

<p><cite>Dark Days</cite> was Joe&rsquo;s last bit of work with his
poor friend but by no means the last of his adaptations
for the stage, the chief of which number
<cite>Madame Sans G&ecirc;ne</cite> for Sir Henry Irving; <cite>My Lady
of Rosedale</cite> for Sir Charles Wyndham; <cite>Nerves</cite>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>which ran with success for some time at the Comedy
Theatre, and last, but not at all least, his fine play
fashioned on Charles Dickens&rsquo; <cite>Oliver Twist</cite> and followed
by one on <cite>Edwin Drood</cite>.</p>

<p>The former, with Sir Herbert Tree as <em>Fagin</em>,
Constance Collier as <em>Nancy</em> and Lyn Harding as
<em>Sikes</em>, held the public for many months both in
London and the United States.</p>

<p>At the height of its London success, a flaw in the
architecture of the central proscenium arch of
His Majesty&rsquo;s Theatre necessitated the temporary
transference of the play to another house. Joe
was naturally in despair, but the untoward incident
in no way interfered with the run of the piece which&mdash;in
the words of the stage manager&mdash;had been
kicked up and down the Strand and only gathered
force as it rolled.</p>

<p>But although I have spoken first of his adaptations,
it is of his original plays that I hold the
dearest memories; and first and foremost of <cite>King
Arthur</cite> which contains some of the best of the
lyrics and blank verse for which Theodore Watts
Dunton held him to be a &ldquo;true poet.&rdquo; The <cite>May
Song</cite> and <cite>Song of the Grail</cite> he placed himself among
his best verse and they were well appreciated.</p>

<p>As the book was published by Messrs. Macmillan,
it belongs to the public.</p>

<p>The production of <cite>King Arthur</cite> was one of the
most beautiful of Henry Irving&rsquo;s many Lyceum
triumphs. Even in those far-removed days Sir Edward
Burne Jones&rsquo; exquisite designs for the armour and
dresses, as well as for the scenery, will be remembered
by some, and I am proud to think that I was allowed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>the privilege of carrying out some of them in detail.
It was a hard six months&rsquo; work but it was well rewarded
and I think Joe had no happier hours than
those he spent in the writing and in the producing
of his two finest efforts&mdash;<cite>King Arthur</cite> and <cite>Tristram
and Iseult</cite>.</p>

<p>I cannot leave this subject without mention of
the tender and lovely impersonation of <cite>Guinevere</cite>
by Ellen Terry, and the touching tribute to her
which Joe himself gives in the following dedication,
written on the fly-leaf of the copy he presented to her.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&ldquo;To Guinevere herself from one who, after years
of closest friendship, looks to her now as always, for
the vindication of what is highest and gentlest in
womanhood; and who would count this not too poor
a gift for her to take, could he but hope that some
part of the grace and charm of her spirit had found
its way into the portrait of Arthur&rsquo;s Queen.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>Following on this it would seem incongruous in
connection with anyone else but Joe to quote a
funny tale bearing on the above; but Joe loved the
tale himself and often told it merrily and so will I.</p>

<p>On his being presented to a newly-arrived prominent
American at a public dinner, this gentleman
opened the conversation by saying that he had
been privileged, on the voyage with Sir Henry
Irving and Ellen Terry, to read <cite>King Arthur</cite> in
the lady&rsquo;s own copy containing the author&rsquo;s charming
dedication. A pause ensued, when Joe&mdash;thinking
himself on solid ground&mdash;said: &ldquo;Well, sir, I hope
you liked the play?&rdquo; What was his astonishment
at the Yankee&rsquo;s gentle reply! &ldquo;Well, not very
much!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;You see I had Lord Tennyson in
my mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>Silence ensued but I think Joe explained with
urbanity that he had taken an entirely different
view of the old legend, founded in a measure on Sir
Thomas Malory&rsquo;s version.</p>

<p><em>A propos</em> of this old name, Joe has himself told
of the arrival at the theatre of a batch of press
cuttings addressed to that knight of the days of
chivalry, the title tactfully supplemented by the
affix of &ldquo;Bart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Perhaps scarcely less funny and more unpardonable
was the question of the Society lady who asked
him, in the case of <cite>Tristram and Iseult</cite>, how he had
obtained Mme. Wagner&rsquo;s consent to tamper with her
husband&rsquo;s book.</p>

<p>A play&mdash;<cite>The Lonely Queen</cite>&mdash;on which he spent
much care, still remains to be performed when a
suitable actress shall present herself for the strong
and sympathetic part of the girlish ruler over a
wild land.</p>

<p>The piece opens on a hillside overlooking an
Eastern city&mdash;a scene shewn again later on in
sinister circumstances; and with dance and
laughter, a group of girls crown their wayward
young mistress with a wreath of flowers in merry
mimicry of the weightier diadem she will soon be
called to wear. And presently, in a lonely mood
of apprehension, she meets as a stranger, the patriot-poet
who is to be both her bane and her salvation
in the future.</p>

<p>He enjoyed writing this play and was pleased
with the following lyric, which he read to me&mdash;as I
am proud to think, he generally read anything
with which he was satisfied or on which he wanted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>such criticism as I could give&mdash;on the very morning
when he had written it.</p>

<p>It was a fair scene in which it was written&mdash;a
hill-top under Monte Rosa overlooking the lovely
shores of Lugano&mdash;and, though he always said that
actual surroundings were never proper to be described
in the work of the moment but must be
digested and crystallized in the hidden corners of
remembrance, I think that the spirit of a place did
influence him, so that the sun shone on the hillside
of the first Act of <cite>The Lonely Queen</cite> as the lowering
brow of the Black Mount, at Rannoch, seemed to
overshadow the halls of Camelot; he even said
himself that he could see the barge with Elaine&rsquo;s
body float down the Hertfordshire stream where he
was wont to fish after his day&rsquo;s labour.</p>

<p>His poetical work was always that which lay
nearest his heart, though his friends often deplored
that he did not devote himself more to comedy;
but strange to say, his humour, which was so inexhaustible
in colloquial intercourse, did not strike
home so surely in his stage dialogue: he needed the
stimulus of conversation. Possibly he felt this,
which made him shyer of comedy-writing than he
would have been; in <cite>Nerves</cite> he was witty enough
and there is a very deft comedy scene for two old
ladies in <cite>Forgiveness</cite>, produced at the &ldquo;St. James&rsquo;&rdquo;
Theatre by Sir George Alexander. His first attempts
at dramatic work, made on the tiny stage
of German Reed&rsquo;s, were entirely in quaint comedy.</p>

<p>I think a free rendering of a fancy of Hugh Conway&rsquo;s
on the Blue-and-White China Craze was one of
the first things he did for the stage and it contained
some charming lyrics after the Elizabethan manner
which won instant recognition.</p>

<p>In the Beauty-Stone Joe was only responsible
for the lyrics and parts of the plot. But I know that
his idea of the man&rsquo;s true love being first awakened
after he became blind was dear to him, and he used
it again in his adaptation of Jekyll and Hyde for
H. B. Irving; but there it is the wife whose blindness
hides from her all but the beautiful side of her
husband.</p>

<p>Such were the chief of Joe&rsquo;s plays. Tireless energy
was given to the production of them all, for I think
it was universally admitted that no one bore the
strain of rehearsals as cheerily and patiently as Joe.
But these attributes shone equally in his work upon
the plays of others produced during his many years
of management at the Comedy Theatre, at the
Lyceum, after it was taken over by a company, at
His Majesty&rsquo;s when producing plays for Sir Herbert
Tree, and lastly at Covent Garden, where he arranged
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mise en sc&egrave;ne</i> for <cite>Parsifal</cite> at a time when he
was already stricken by failing health.</p>

<p>Many strenuous hours were spent over each of
these ventures in the most arduous of professions;
but what I prefer to recall are the gay ones&mdash;the
merry moments&mdash;the unfailing good humour, wit
and pleasant jest by which my husband lightened
the weary waits with which all who have laboured
for the stage are familiar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rome wasn&rsquo;t built in a day,&rdquo; I can hear him
retort cheerfully to some impatient spectator who
was grumbling at the long waits during the last
rehearsal of <cite>Julius C&aelig;sar</cite> at His Majesty&rsquo;s Theatre;
and none was so ready as his friend the actor-manager,
with the appreciative laugh.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>
<p>Lady Tree&mdash;Maud, to us&mdash;reminds me of his
favourite attitude as he would stand watching the
effects of the lighting of his scenes from the empty
stalls with his stick passed through his arms behind
his back, and his cheery tones uttering the most
fearful anathemas against lime-light men and scene-shifters.</p>

<p>One day I said to him: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get so angry,
Joe, it must tire you out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To which he replied with his usual promptness,
&ldquo;Angry, my dear! Why, I&rsquo;m only using the
language proper to lime-light men: they understand
no other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once at a Christmas rehearsal, when the stage-hands
were all rather more tipsy than was generally
allowable, he came from the stage, and as he sat
down beside me in the stalls he said with a whimsical
smile: &ldquo;Poor old Burnaby! He keeps muttering,
&lsquo;Buried a wife o&rsquo; Toosday and now, s&rsquo;elp me, can&rsquo;t
lay my &rsquo;and on a hammer.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was held in firm affection by his stage-hands
just as he was by his New Gallery staff, not forgetting
the decorators, and those superior frame-gilders
who were only induced by regard for &ldquo;the
boss&rdquo; to work together in completing the
balustrade of the balcony during the strenuous
last days before the opening of that &ldquo;Aladdin&rsquo;s
palace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I recollect one of the scene-shifters at His
Majesty&rsquo;s Theatre putting his shoulder out at a
rehearsal and Joe taking him to hospital himself;
I should never have known of it but that the man&rsquo;s
quaint expression of gratitude&mdash;&ldquo;Your gentlemanly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>conduct, sir, I never shall forget&rdquo;&mdash;so pleased Joe
that he had to repeat it to me.</p>

<p>The humours of these people always delighted
him, and I can see his mock-grave face as he told me
of the head stage-carpenter&rsquo;s refusal to carry out
an order because it was the day upon which:
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all subservient to Mr. Telbin&rdquo;&mdash;an excuse
which Joe, knowing that irascible scene-painter&rsquo;s
peculiarities&mdash;found sufficient.</p>

<p>No memories are pleasanter to me than those of
presentations to us by these working folk. I have
a little Old English silver waiter, an inscribed gift
from the employ&eacute;s at the Comedy Theatre for our
silver wedding; and a ponderous marble clock,
also touchingly inscribed, which the foreman of
the stage-hands in the Lyceum Company presented
to Joe in the library of our Kensington house. The
man stood in the centre of the room making a speech,
but before it was ended nature prevailed and he
concluded hastily: &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t set it down somewhere
I shall let it drop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe had given instructions to our maid to pay
the donor&rsquo;s cab, and when he retired and found it
gone, we were all in dismay upon learning that he
had left his overcoat in it.</p>

<p>Anecdotes of entertainments in the higher circles
of the stage Joe has told himself in his two books of
Reminiscences, the most notable of them being
Henry Irving&rsquo;s splendid reception to the Rajahs,
when the stage and stalls of the Lyceum were transformed
into one vast flower-garden in half an hour
after the fall of the curtain. But I can add my
testimony as to memorable evenings spent at His
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>Majesty&rsquo;s Theatre and at Sir Henry Irving&rsquo;s supper-table
in the &ldquo;Old Beefsteak Room&rdquo; of the Lyceum
Theatre, when I listened proudly to Joe&rsquo;s brilliant
talk or speeches, and was sometimes privileged to
act as interpreter between the host and the many
distinguished foreigners who graced that board.
Liszt, Joachim, Sarasate are names which recur to
me among them as musicians; but, of course, the
guests were chiefly actors and actresses, flattered,
I think, at the fine welcome from the foremost
English Manager.</p>

<p>Booth, Mary Anderson, Mansfield were the foremost
Americans, to the latter of whom I remember
Irving&rsquo;s grim advice <em>&agrave; propos</em> of the fatigue of a
ventriloquist-voice in a gruesome part: &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s
unwholesome I should do it some other way.&rdquo;
Jane Hading, Coquelin, R&eacute;jane and, of course, the
incomparable Sarah Bernhardt represented the
French; and I think Salvini was the only one from
the stage of Italy.</p>

<p>Sarah and our dear Ellen Terry were always great
friends, and I call to mind a pretty little passage
when they were sitting opposite to one another and
Sarah, leaning forward, cried, in response to some
gracious word of Nell&rsquo;s: &ldquo;My dearling, there are two
peoples who shall never be old&mdash;you and me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The words are still, happily, true at the hour when
I write.</p>

<p>Relating to members of the German stage entertained
by Sir Henry, the most amusing incident
is that related by Joe himself in detail: of the
great actor&rsquo;s grim humour in calling upon him
suddenly to speak in praise of the Sax-Meiningen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>Company, when Joe had innocently told him an hour
before that he had been unable to go to any of their
performances. Ladies were not present on that
occasion, but I was told that Joe&rsquo;s speech was one
of the wittiest he ever delivered: there was nothing
that so sharpened his rapier as being apparently
put at a disadvantage.</p>

<p>I find no mention by himself of a similar occurrence
on a different issue. This time Irving had invited
the Oxford and Cambridge crews to supper and, being
suddenly indisposed, was unable to propose their
health. Without even waiting to be asked Joe
rose to his feet and, anxious to divert the young
men&rsquo;s attention from their host, surpassed himself
in exuberant fun, keeping them in a roar of laughter
for a quarter of an hour over his alleged uncertainty
as to which of the two &rsquo;Varsities had secured the
honours of the boat-race.</p>

<p>I am told that Joe again acquitted himself well at
a dinner given to Arthur Balfour, when Anthony
Hope called upon him without notice from the
chair to return thanks for his proposed health.
I don&rsquo;t know why or how the inspiration came, but
&ldquo;Love&rdquo; was Joe&rsquo;s topic, and it is easy to imagine
what a gracious and merry time he made with the
various aspects of this subject.</p>

<p>Of his meetings with Italian actors and actresses
Joe does not speak save in the instance of Madame
Ristori, for whose genius he had an unsurpassed
veneration.</p>

<p>His <cite>Eminent Victorians</cite> contains the tale of an
afternoon at her house when she had invited him
and one or two of the dramatic critics to hear her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>speak <cite>Lady Macbeth&rsquo;s</cite> sleep-walking scene in
English with a view to doing it before a British
audience.</p>

<p>Her large and sonorous rendering of the line
&ldquo;All the perfumes of Ar&acirc;bia&rdquo; delighted him, though
he tried to teach her our own insular pronunciation;
he was loudly in favour of the public performance
in English, which she finally gave, and I shall never
forget the awe-inspiring effect of the slow and gentle
snoring which she kept running through the whole
of the speech.</p>

<p>Joe never admired even Salvini as much, though
he revelled in his great voice on the resounding
Roman tongue. He made us all laugh one day by
mimicking the mincing tones of a Cockney interpreter
translating the Italian tragedian&rsquo;s sonorous
language when returning thanks for his London
welcome at a public dinner.</p>

<p>Eleonora Duse, for whom our Nell had the most
ardent admiration, was rarely able, by reason of
her frail health, to grace festive occasions after her
work; but Joe had one or two interesting meetings
with her during the season that she rented one of
the theatres that he managed and we were all present
together at her pathetic performance of the <cite>Dame
aux Camelias</cite>; the next night we witnessed Sarah
Bernhardt in the same r&ocirc;le, and Joe gives an able
comparison of the two performances in <cite>Coasting
Bohemia</cite>. On the latter occasion a note came round
to Nell from the stage saying: &ldquo;To-night I play for
you.&rdquo; And the promise was well kept.</p>

<p>Speaking of Sarah Bernhardt, I recall a happening
of the days before Joe was entitled to the con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>sideration
due to a theatrical manager; he had
obtained a promise from the famous lady that she
would lunch with us in our quiet home and we
bade to meet her not by any means our &ldquo;second-best&rdquo;
friends&mdash;to quote a huffed English actor
regarding the guests of another evening. We waited
an hour with a patient party and then Joe hastened
with a cab to fetch the lady, only to be told that she
had forgotten the engagement and was in her bath
preparing to keep another. I need not perhaps
record that Joe&rsquo;s wit was equal to the occasion in
pacifying our outraged guests.</p>

<p>He and Sarah became firm friends later, and she
had Joe&rsquo;s <cite>King Arthur</cite> translated into French with
a view to playing the part of <cite>Lancelot</cite>; but this
intention was never carried out.</p>

<p>So many and various are the memories which
crowd upon me connected with the stage that it is
quite impossible for me to sift and record them
without undue risk of boring any readers I may
have. Suffice it to say that I think, of his many
occupations, the theatre, whether in writing for it or
in labouring at productions upon it, was the one
which most entranced and held Joe. Not only
did he love every detail of the work, but it brought
him in daily contact with all sorts and conditions
of men and women, taxed his powers as a leader of
them and gave him hourly opportunity for the
exercise of his humanizing and inspiring gift:
that highest kind of humour which needs no preparation,
but is evoked by every little passing
incident and has its real might in the love of
mankind.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>
<p>Perhaps I may here quote a portion of an American
interviewer&rsquo;s account of a talk with Henry Irving,
sent to Joe by J. L. Toole during one of his old
friend&rsquo;s long tours in the United States.</p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">&ldquo;The Wittiest Man in England.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Whom do you consider the wittiest man in
England to-day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, in my opinion, the greatest of our wits is
a man of whom very little is known out here. He is
Comyns Carr, who wrote <cite>King Arthur</cite> for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is a theatrical manager in London, is he not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, at the present he is, but he is a distinguished
man in literature as well. A polished essayist and
the most sparkling man I have ever met. As an
extemporaneous speaker he is delightful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he an Irishman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he is, originally. Now you speak of
it. Do you know if Carr is an Irish name? Comyns
is at any rate and then most of our celebrated wits
have been Irishmen&mdash;our Sheridans and our Goldsmiths?&rdquo;</p>

<p>With this pleasing tribute to my husband I may
fitly close these theatrical reminiscences, though I
like to recall that Joe and Henry Irving had appreciations
of one another on a graver side to which some
pages in <cite>Eminent Victorians</cite> testify, and many are
the pleasant holiday hours we spent as his guests
both abroad and at home. He used to visit the old-world
village of Winchelsea by Rye, where we had
a cottage close to the ancient gateway of the town&mdash;afterwards
sold to Ellen Terry.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>
<p>But the most notable of our joint trips was that
to Nuremberg in search of material for the production
of <cite>Faust</cite>. This was the first occasion on which I
made a hit with my designing of Ellen Terry&rsquo;s
dresses, which I afterwards did for nearly twenty
years. Being the only one of the party speaking
German, I made many bargains in the shops and
on the old market-place chiefly under Joe&rsquo;s direction
but also by request of Henry or Nell. She bought
me a solid housewife&rsquo;s copper jug in the market, and
Joe and I secured an old ivory casket which she
accepted from us and in which she kept the gew-gaws
in the &ldquo;Jewel Scene.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She and I had a delightful evening in the old
Castle, I having persuaded a little girl-custodian
to let us in after hours so that we saw the place in
solemn loneliness with the sunset glow reddening
the red roofs of the city far below us.</p>

<p>I won the admission by a highly coloured description
of the actress in Shakespeare, which the child
actually had seen in her own town; and Nell
promised her a signed photograph&mdash;punctually
posted on our return.</p>

<p>This excursion was made while Joe and Henry
were away at Rothenburg, which my husband had
insisted that Irving must see on account of its
unique preservation of untouched city-wall and
battlements.</p>

<p>It was a memorable tour, of which Joe tells some
interesting anecdotes in <cite>Coasting Bohemia</cite>.</p>

<p>In speaking of the long drives which his host
loved and so greatly preferred to any kind of exercise,
Joe does not confess, however, how impossible he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>found it to keep himself awake. &ldquo;We sit side by
side and sleep for hours!&rdquo; he would tell me regretfully
when he came home. And I don&rsquo;t suppose it
occurred to any of us then that it was the best rest
that tired theatrical managers could have.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="center">ENTERTAINMENT</p>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">This</span> is a topic upon which I touch timidly; not
only because Joe has talked of it himself in <cite>Some
Eminent Victorians</cite>, but also because I had, perhaps
less than most of his friends, the opportunity to
appreciate his gifts as a public, or even a social,
entertainer. In the long list of his after-dinner
speeches there were not more than half a dozen that
I was lucky enough to hear; and the little corner
in the Garrick Club where I know he was wont to
sit, quickly attracting thither the most appreciative
spirits and keeping them all the evening in a
ripple of laughter, was obviously a forbidden spot
to me.</p>

<p>I think his celebrity in this matter needs no
mention of mine; but I should like to quote one
or two appreciations by distinguished literary men.</p>

<p>The first is in a letter to myself, where Anthony
Hope draws a remarkable portrait of him: &ldquo;He
was a great arguer,&rdquo; he writes; &ldquo;for while his temper
was always serene, his good humour did not blunt
the edge of his tongue. Quite recently I have reread
his last book with the keenest appreciation;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>it shows a broad, appreciative mind, and yet one
quite clear for values and criterions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have lost a man of rare gifts, a splendid
companion, a generous, kindly, gracious friend.
One is happy in having known him, happy too in
feeling that life was to him a fine thing&mdash;a thing he
loved, appreciated and used to the utmost. And
his name will live&mdash;I think that will be proved true&mdash;in
the memories of men and in their written
records of these times.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was a figure and a presence amongst us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another appreciation is by W. J. Locke and
appeared in one of the leading papers:</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a brief notice like the present it is impossible
to dwell on the career of one of the most versatile
of our profession. Everything he touched he
adorned with his own peculiar sense of artistic
perfection. He was an eminent art critic, a theatrical
manager with high ideals, an editor of fine discernment,
and a distinguished playwright. He was one
of the finest after-dinner speakers of his generation,
and one of the few men who earned, maintained,
and deserved the reputation of a wit. A writer in
a recent newspaper article wrongly charged him
with being rather a monologuist in social talk than
a conversationalist. Far from this being the case,
no one more fully appreciated and practised the
delicate art of conversation. It may be said,
perhaps, that he was one of the youngest&mdash;he died
in his sixty-eighth year&mdash;and one of the last of the
great Victorians; for though his keen intellect
never lost touch with the events and movements of
recent years, yet his mental attitude was typically
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>that of the second half of the nineteenth century
in its sturdy radicalism, its search after essentials,
its abhorrence of shams, and its lusty enjoyment
of what was real and good in life. The honest
workman with pen or brush always found at his
hands generous praise or encouragement; for the
charlatan, or &lsquo;Jack Pudding,&rsquo; as he was fond of
terming him, he had no mercy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Struggling against grievous physical disability,
he died practically in harness. His last book, a
treatise on painting, completed but a month or two
ago, is said by those privileged to read the proofs,
to reveal a vigour unimpaired by illness and an
enthusiasm undimmed by age. An arresting and
lovable figure has passed from us, one that linked us
with a generation of giants whose work was ending
when ours began. It is for us, with sadness, to say,
<em>Vale</em>: but we know that their honoured shades
will greet with many an <em>ave</em> the advent of &lsquo;Joe&rsquo;
Carr on the banks of Acheron.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Two more extracts from letters, I have the permission
of the writers to quote. One is from A. E. W.
Mason:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The traits and qualities which come back to
me,&rdquo; he writes, are &ldquo;his boyish spirit, his sense of
fun, his swiftness in dropping out of fun and suddenly
touching upon great themes with the surest
possible touch, his knowledge of Shakespeare, his
passion for Dickens,&rdquo; etc. And the other is in the
letter of affectionate sympathy written to me at the
time of his death by one of the oldest and most
valued of his friends, Sir Frederick Macmillan:</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was one of the most gifted and brilliant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>creatures I have ever known, and had such a kindly
nature that no one could come across him without
loving him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am proud to think that it was my privilege
to give him his last literary commission, and that
it has resulted in such a fine piece of work in the
region in which he had always been a master.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This allusion is to <cite>The Ideals of Painting</cite>, published
posthumously and still before the public.</p>

<p>The following notice appeared in the <cite>Manchester
Guardian</cite>:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The remarkable thing about Mr. Joseph Comyns
Carr was that, while his reputation as a talker and
after-dinner speaker was made in the late Victorian
days, his gift was so genuine and so deep-set in
human nature that even in these days when the
whole poise of humour is changed, people still spoke
of him as our best man. I doubt if anyone could
stand the Victorian after-dinner speeches that
established reputations, or if Wilde himself would
keep the table quiet, but, until near the end, Carr
was the person organisers of dinners first thought of
when they wanted a toast list that would attract
guests. He had a Johnsonian decisiveness and real
brilliance of definition, with a freakish fancy and
playfulness that at times had much of Henley&rsquo;s
saltness and ferocity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I am bound to say I never heard the ferocity,
but then there were ladies present when I was.
His chaff was sometimes keen, it is true, and at our
friends&rsquo; houses I sometimes sat quaking for fear it
should give offence; but even I underrated the
power of his personality and the deep affection in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>which he was universally held, and I did not guess
till he was gone the wealth of friends who missed him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There should be a monument erected to him for
having cheered more folk and made more laughter
than anyone did before him,&rdquo; said one; and so it
was even in the less inspiring surroundings of his
own home.</p>

<p>My mind goes back to the first frugal little dinners
of our early life, given when we had moved from
the rooms over the dispensary in Great Russell
Street to a proper house in Blandford Square, now
the Great Central Railway Station.</p>

<p>He always did his own carving, and later taught
our daughter to be nearly as expert as he was at it;
no amount of pleading for the &ldquo;table decoration&rdquo;
from our handsome parlour-maid would deter him,
and she and I had cause to weep over splashed
brocade table-centres which were the fashion of the
hour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What <i>is</i> this bird, my dear?&rdquo; he asked one night
about some moderate-priced game which I thought
I had &ldquo;discovered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hazel-grouse, Joe,&rdquo; faltered I, guessing that
some reproof was coming.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nasal-grouse, you mean,&rdquo; said he; promptly
adding for my consolation, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a bit of a foreigner,
you see, so they take her in about our English birds.
Never mind, dear! This bird&rsquo;s muscles are less
tough, at all events, than those of your country fowl
who walked from Devonshire last week.&rdquo; And he
turned to his friends and added:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span> &ldquo;I can give you
nothing but the plainest of food, but I always take
a pride in its being the best of its kind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was his unfailing word: &ldquo;The best is good
enough for me!&rdquo; he would say; and he would
go himself to the butcher if the Sunday beef had not
been succulent, and say kindly: &ldquo;You need not
trouble to send me anything but the best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was why his friends set so much store by
his gastronomic opinion&mdash;he was a great judge of
food, he had it both from his Irish mother and his
Cumberland father; he knew good meat when he
saw it, as that astute friend of his, the Hertfordshire
butcher already mentioned, would tell him; and no
one appreciated this more than the late Lord Burnham.
They both agreed that plain fare was always
the finest&mdash;<i>but</i> it must be of the best. A cold sirloin
must be served uncut, yet the host of those memorable
week-end parties at Hall Barn always knew
whether it would be &ldquo;prime&rdquo; <i>when</i> cut and would
beg Joe to keep a good portion of his appetite for the
tasting of it. Neither of them gave the first place
to made-dishes, though Joe could enjoy these
when perfect&mdash;as they were at that bountiful
table.</p>

<p>The made-dishes of unknown cooks he always
mistrusted, especially when he had reason to fear
that the dinner would be of what he called &ldquo;the
green-grocer&rsquo;s and pastry-cook&rsquo;s&rdquo; class; and I
remember his wicked assertion that his &ldquo;inside was
rattling like a pea in a canister&rdquo; with all the tinned
food that he had eaten at one such entertainment.</p>

<p>Alas, that he should have been condemned to
some of it, through war necessities, at the end of his
life!</p>

<p>He would take pains sometimes in instructing me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>and our own humble cook in the concoction of some
new dish from a good receipt; but nothing was to
be spared in the cost of the necessary ingredients:
the soup, fish or <em>entree</em> must be made &ldquo;of the best,&rdquo;
not forgetting that the &ldquo;pig and onion were the
North and South poles of cookery;&rdquo; and, I think,
he might have added also the oyster.</p>

<p>His Christmas turkey was almost always boiled,
after his mother&rsquo;s Irish method, stuffed with oysters
and served with fried pork sausages and a lavish
oyster sauce or a <em>vol-au-vent</em> of the same; latterly
the oysters always came in a barrel from our kind
friend &ldquo;Bertie&rdquo; Sullivan.</p>

<p>Yes, his friends esteemed him highly as a food
expert; there is a letter from Edward Burne-Jones
(quoted, I think, by Joe) in which he begs him to
order the dinner for some entertainment of his own.
&ldquo;Oh, dear Carr, save my honour,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;I
know no more what dinner to order than the cat on
the hearth&mdash;less, for she would promptly order mice.
Oh, Carr, order a nice dinner so that I may not be
quoted as a warning of meanness ... yet not
ostentatious and presuming such as would foolishly
compete with the banquets of the affluent. O,
Carr, come to the rescue!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This dear friend cared comparatively little for the
pleasures of the table, but Joe was even privileged
to pass on one of his receipts to an acknowledged
<em>gourmet</em>: it was the simmering of a ham half the
time in stock and vegetables, and the remainder in
champagne&mdash;or, failing that, in any good white
wine; and as for his salads, he was famed for them.</p>

<p>I can see the pretty little plate of chives and other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>chopped herbs, with yoke and white of hard-boiled
mashed egg, that our French <em>bourgeoise</em> cook would
send up ready for his meticulous choice in the mixing
of either a Russian or a lettuce salad: &ldquo;a niggard
of vinegar, a spendthrift of oil, and a maniac at
mixing,&rdquo; was the old adage he went by.</p>

<p>Our cooks were always as proud as I was to try
and follow out his ideas, and we were invariably
praised for success: I remember an occasion when
the confused damsel&mdash;partly because she happened
to be very pretty&mdash;was summoned to the dining-room
to receive her meed; and when it was blame,
I caught the brunt of it and mitigated the dose
downstairs.</p>

<p>But as it was always in the form of fun I never
minded; I was always proud to be the butt of it.
Sometimes I scored, as when the dessert came at
that first party, and he said, offering a dish of sweets
to his neighbour:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Try a preserved fruit; they&rsquo;ve stood the move
from Bloomsbury wonderfully well,&rdquo; and I was able
to produce the freshly opened box, just arrived
from a choice foreign firm, and prove my hospitality
to be less stinted.</p>

<p>I had my partisans in those days. Pellegrini, the
<cite>Vanity Fair</cite> caricaturist, was one of them. I hailed
from his own country, and I can hear him say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never minder Joe! You and I we &rsquo;ave de sun
in de eyes.&rdquo; And then we would discuss the proper
condiment for <em>maccaroni</em>, and next time he came he
would bring it ready cooked in a fireproof dish,
tenderly carried on his lap in the hansom, which
he insisted upon placing on the proper spot of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>kitchen stove to warm: on such nights, he ate little
of our British fare.</p>

<p>My husband and he were fast friends nevertheless.
If Joe had not &ldquo;de sun in de eyes&rdquo; he had it in the
heart, and Pellegrini adored him, even going so far
once as to break his oath never to sleep out of his
own lodgings, that he might visit us at a cottage on
the Thames, where&mdash;although he allowed that the
moon &ldquo;she is a beauty&rdquo;&mdash;he used cold cream and
kid gloves to counteract the ill-effects of hard water,
and sat up all night rather than retire to a strange
bed.</p>

<p>Several tales of this lovable and laughable character
are told in <cite>Eminent Victorians</cite>, most of them referring
to those happy little homely dinner parties where
Joe shone so pleasantly, and which his friends not
only graced with their presence, but even sometimes
contributed to by little kindly presentations of
delicacies.</p>

<p>Perhaps few have received as much kindness as
Joe did, and though always grateful, he was never
overwhelmed. Of the pride which resents gifts he
had none. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t take a jot from any but a
friend,&rdquo; he would say. &ldquo;But if a friend, who has
more than I, likes to share it with me, why should I
refuse? I would do the same for him. I have no
money, but I give him what I possess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And none who knew him&mdash;rich or poor&mdash;in any
of his many spheres, but would testify to this: he
gave the young of his wise and tactful advice in their
careers, sparing no time or trouble to advance those
who were steadfast of purpose; he gave to his
contemporaries of his untiring sympathy&mdash;known
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>only to those who received it; he gave of his cheerful
optimism to all: no form of envy ever crossed his
mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can enjoy fine things just as well when they
belong to others as to me,&rdquo; he would say. Of none
are the words truer: &ldquo;Having nothing yet possessing
all things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But this graver digression has led me far from that
merry Christmas party, when the parlour-maid, whose
beauty was an attraction of our first home, and
whose charm and devotion for eleven years are one
of its sweetest memories, was forced to retire to the
sideboard to compose her face; which sort of thing
did not only occur at our own table, but at far
smarter houses where decorous butlers would bow
their heads lower to conceal their smiles, the
mistress of one of them even declaring that her
maggiordomo had not considered the company that
evening worthy of Joe, and had suggested a different
choice for a future party.</p>

<p>There was one over-cultured house to which we
used to be bidden where the learned hostess was
mated to a meek alien, who never presumed to
understand her conversation. One evening, before
the fish was removed, she leant forward and called
down the table to Joe: &ldquo;Mr. Comyns Carr, would
you kindly inform us &lsquo;what is style?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe scarcely paused before he replied with his
sunniest smile, &ldquo;Not before the sweets, Madam.&rdquo;
And he turned pleasantly to the amazed host and
began complimenting him on the excellence of his
claret.</p>

<p>I think, although I am afraid I have heard him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>call that host a &ldquo;Prince of Duldoggery,&rdquo; he preferred
him that night to the lady of culture, though she
was too serious to be included in his pet aversions,
the &ldquo;Lady Sarah Volatile&rsquo;s&rdquo; or &ldquo;jumping-cats&rdquo;
of Society.</p>

<p>But even among such, how prompt he was to
detect the tiniest spark of genuine knowledge or
enthusiasm, the most foolishly concealed quality of
true womanliness and devotion.</p>

<p>I remember a girl-friend of his daughter&rsquo;s, boasting
to him in defiance of his counsel, that she would
drive to Ascot alone in an admirer&rsquo;s car.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No you won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Joe quietly.</p>

<p>And loudly as she persisted that night&mdash;she did <i>not</i>.</p>

<p>I could multiply these instances by the score, for
even in middle age he was the darling of all girls,
though he always told them home-truths, and many
was the match he made or wisely marred in the
confidential corner of a drawing-room.</p>

<p>Whether in the quiet or the open, of course, he
always talked the better for his cigar, and to some
the sight of the matches he wasted while seeking the
positively apt word was a joy in itself&mdash;or an annoyance,
as the case might be.</p>

<p>I know one dear friend who could not listen for
irritation, and would burst out at last: &ldquo;Light
your pipe, first, old man, do!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yet there were times when he had no pipe to
light&mdash;in smart drawing-rooms or theatre stalls,
for instance. He was very naughty in the latter,
and kept me in a fever lest, being so well known,
some one should overhear him who could make
mischief.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>
<p>Once he was reproved by the management for
making his party laugh immoderately in the stage-box
at a sorely dull farcical comedy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pray present my compliments to the manager,&rdquo;
said Joe suavely to the attendant who had brought
the message, &ldquo;and assure him that we were not
laughing at anything on the stage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The speech he was proud to make every 8th of
January in honour of his dear old friend, Sir Lawrence
Alma-Tadema&rsquo;s birthday, and the good wishes which
for many years he voiced for many friends at Sir
George and Lady Lewis&rsquo; New-Year parties, will
not perhaps be altogether forgotten, nor could I
recall the topical interests of the moment after
so long.</p>

<p>But those who knew him best knew that the
opportunities for witty rejoinder and humorous
invention were by no means limited to set occasions;
they were instantly seized on provocation which
no one else would have perceived, and as often in
the simplicity of domestic life as in the society of
clever people who might have been supposed to
inspire him.</p>

<p>Who but Joe, when a picnic was spread beneath
the trees in the woods at Walton, and a combative
young curate, claiming to have secured the spot,
swooped down upon us with his Sunday-school
flock, would have whispered merrily: &ldquo;Never
mind! We&rsquo;ll cut him according to his cloth!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Or who, on being asked by a lady which was my
&ldquo;At Home&rdquo; day, would have replied: &ldquo;Let me
see! Sunday is the Lord&rsquo;s Day, and Monday is
my wife&rsquo;s day;&rdquo; or, in the days of my slenderness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>and his more opulent figure, would have declared
that, taking the average, we were the thinnest
couple in London?</p>

<p>These trivial jokes will seem poor to the friends
who have heard his later and more brilliant <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon-mots</i>
and have listened to his longer orations; but, as
I have said, I know little of those public speeches.
The most notable of these at which I remember
being present was at a dinner of the Royal Literary
Fund, when he spoke long and with deep illumination
on his beloved Charles Dickens; he always spoke
at the various commemorative entertainments given
in the great novelist&rsquo;s honour, but never so brilliantly
and so profoundly as that time.</p>

<p>When the occasion was more formal&mdash;as when he
took the chair at the Actors&rsquo; Benevolent or the
Dramatic and Musical Fund&mdash;he would sometimes
recite to me beforehand part of the speech which he
intended to deliver, but I believe he rarely stuck to
his plan, and I have heard him say that he preferred
merely to prepare the &ldquo;joints&rdquo; of his subject&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
each new departure&mdash;and to leave all the filling-in
to the inspiration of the moment as influenced
by the foregoing speaker or any unforeseen incident.</p>

<p>I recollect that the peroration of a speech for the
Dramatic and Musical Fund ended: &ldquo;I plead not
so much for the deserving as for the undeserving,&rdquo;
and I believe that he added: &ldquo;of whom I am one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I know that he told me next day&mdash;half in glee,
but much also in pride&mdash;that the Toastmaster had
told him that he had never stood behind a chair
and seen so much money raked in.</p>

<p>It was certainly to his mastery of the impromptu
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>that he owed the triumph of his oration before the
U.S. Ambassador, Mr. Bayard, at a moment when
war seemed suddenly possible with our great
English-speaking neighbour; and I recollect that
Ellen Terry, who was then in New York, told me
later that when Joe&rsquo;s speech appeared in the papers
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en r&eacute;sum&eacute;</i> (it never could be wholly reported owing
to his making no notes) there was a marked change
in the tide of feeling.</p>

<p>He has related a part of this incident in his
<cite>Eminent Victorians</cite>, but he has not mentioned this
last particular, neither has he told how his triumph
was won by his large appreciation of the love lavished
upon the giants of our English literature by our
&ldquo;friends across the seas.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="center">HOLIDAYS</p>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">A happy</span> chapter this: for though Joe always had
so many irons in the fire that lengthy holidays were
not only very few with him but actually avoided and
disliked, he made merry so well by the wayside
that many a memory falls into a category scarcely
enshrined in a longer period than a summer afternoon,
or at most, a week-end trip; he made holiday for
other folk all the time, and in so doing made it for
himself.</p>

<p>Of week-end visits none were more joyous than
those spent under the hospitable roof of our friends
Sir George and Lady Lewis at Walton-on-Thames,
where Sir Edward Burne-Jones was a constant
visitor. Neither of those friends were knighted or
baroneted then, so that perhaps we might all have
been said to be&mdash;using Joe&rsquo;s own words&mdash;&ldquo;of the
lower middle class, to which I am proud to belong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Oscar Wilde was often of the Walton party&mdash;fresh
from Oxford then, and considerably esteemed
as a wit himself, though not, as Joe shows in his
Reminiscences, always above the suspicion of
borrowing.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>
<p>In this respect he somewhat resembled Whistler;
but the latter was more honest in his plagiarism.</p>

<p>One day Whistler accused Joe of making a joke
at the expense of his friend&mdash;a false accusation in
reality, though sometimes lightly true&mdash;to which
Joe quickly answered: &ldquo;Well, I can make a friend
most days, but I can only make a good joke now
and then:&rdquo; assuredly only half a truth, too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha! ha!&rdquo; laughed Whistler with his shrill
cackle, &ldquo;I wish I had said that myself!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind, Jimmy, you will,&rdquo; retorted Joe.</p>

<p>And the cackle broke forth again whole-heartedly,
whereas Wilde might possibly have been offended.</p>

<p>But very few folk were ever offended at my
husband&rsquo;s fun.</p>

<p>One of the members said to him one day at the
Garrick Club, in a whimsical and deprecating manner:
&ldquo;These fellows tell me that I have the reputation of
a wit, my dear Carr.&rdquo; To which Joe replied: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
worry! you&rsquo;ll live that down in an afternoon.&rdquo;
And I am told that the friend was wont to repeat
this against himself. Again, the mother of a pretty
young girl, whom he was openly flattering, asked
him, laughing, whether his intentions were serious,
to which he replied: &ldquo;Serious, but not honourable,
madam.&rdquo; But if this lady was not offended
perhaps it was because he had known her
since the time when she was fourteen years old
herself.</p>

<p>An evening in Lady Lewis&rsquo; pretty drawing-room
at the Walton cottage comes vividly back to me.
We were playing some geographical game with the
children, in the course of which Oscar Wilde&mdash;with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>a view to grown-up applause&mdash;found occasion to
ask: &ldquo;Where is the capital of the Rothschilds?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The children looked blank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, in Behring Straits,&rdquo; said Joe promptly,
and I remember old Sir George Lewis&rsquo; smile, for it
was at the time of the famous city crisis when, but
for that capital, the great firm of Baring might have
stopped payment.</p>

<p>Even in that most precarious form of fun, the
practical joke, Joe was never known to hurt even
the most thin-skinned.</p>

<p>One day he and Mr. Hall&eacute;, his co-director at the
New Gallery&mdash;made an excursion to Sir Edward
Burne-Jones&rsquo; home&mdash;The Grange, Kensington&mdash;and
sent up a message to the artist asking if he would
receive two gentlemen who had called to ask whether
he would take shares in the <cite>Great Wheel</cite>. The maid
must have been sore put to it to keep her countenance,
for the rage with which the painter viewed
the monstrosity that climbed the sky above his
garden wall was well known in his household.</p>

<p>He rushed downstairs, palette in hand, only to
find &ldquo;little Carr,&rdquo; as he affectionately called him,
waiting demurely in the hall on quite other business.</p>

<p>At the sweet Rottingdean home a similar joke
was played: Burne-Jones&rsquo; loathing of the &ldquo;interviewer&rdquo;
was a very open secret; so one summer
evening Joe crept up to the front door and sent in
an audacious name, purporting to be that of an
American who hoped for a few words with the distinguished
artist.</p>

<p>From the shade of the porch he peeped into the
dining-room window, and had the satisfaction of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>seeing his friend creep under the dinner-table, while
the maid returned with the message that Sir Edward
Burne-Jones was not at home. I think Joe&rsquo;s familiar
back was quickly recognised as he walked, in mock
dignity, down the garden path, and he was not
sent empty away.</p>

<p>Of course, the practical jokes of which he shared
the invention with his good friend J. L. Toole&mdash;a
master of the craft&mdash;were the most cunningly devised.
He has related the choicest in <cite>Eminent Victorians</cite>,
but I could tell of many a family laugh over them,
and &ldquo;One more Tooler, father, before we go to bed,&rdquo;
was a common request.</p>

<p>One of the favourite stories was told of him when
travelling down with Joe to the beautiful old moated
house at Ightham, which our American friends,
General and Mrs. Palmer, had made their English
home. Stopping at a wayside station above which
a lordly mansion stood among the trees, Toole
beckoned a porter and, in the gibberish that he used
so glibly at these moments, pretended to utter the
name of its owner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you mean Mr. So-and-So,&rdquo; said the porter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course&mdash;I said so!&rdquo; retorted the shameless
comedian. &ldquo;Well, here&rsquo;s half a crown. When the
train&rsquo;s off, run up to the house and say &lsquo;we
shall be seven to dinner and the game will
follow.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The whistle went as the porter, holding on to the
door, enquired: &ldquo;Who shall I say, Sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the train moved on and Toole returned to the
reading of his paper, leaving a gaping man on the
platform.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>
<p>This same Ightham Mote was the scene of many
of our happiest hours. Its charming hostess was a
dear friend whose rare gifts of sympathy and true
hospitality enabled her not only to attract to her
house the brightest of spirits, but also to draw from
them their best. Children, too, to whom she was a
fairy godmother, were welcome as friends in their
own right. Our daughter and younger son were
specially dear to her in their different ways, and
many was the grave, childish saying of the latter
that she would repeat to the proud father, though
perhaps the one he oftenest told himself was said
to Alma Tadema when the five-year-old boy remarked
that he preferred a gas to a coal fire, because the first
went out when <i>you</i> liked, and the latter when <i>it</i> liked.</p>

<p>Joe was appreciated of all children and always
won their favour easily; but I remember one little
lady administering a severe rebuff to him when,
after many lures, he said at last: &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t
care whether you come or not!&rdquo; to which she
replied: &ldquo;Oh, yes, you do!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But that was an exception; they were usually his
slaves, and loved his stories as much as their elders
did. He treated them as his equals only requiring
that they should do the same; and when his first
grandson was born and some one alluded to him as
a proud grandfather, he said: &ldquo;I like the child,
but there&rsquo;s to be no grandfather about it. I&rsquo;m
to be Joe to him as to others.&rdquo; And so he was to
the children of that dear lady in beautiful Ightham
Mote.</p>

<p>Christmas was a real Yuletide in the fine old
wainscoted hall and library, where Joe was always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>ready for the revel, as he was for the outdoor sports
with his own children and those of the house. There
were games in the beautiful old quadrangle and
fishing feats from the bridges that lead across the
moat to the bowling-green beyond; but the latter
must have been worse than a bad joke to an expert
angler such as my husband&mdash;consisting as they did
in trying to lure the trout by a bait tied on to a
hairpin; luckily the fish swam away merrily and
perhaps enjoyed the fun too.</p>

<p>Frederick Jameson, that earliest friend of the days
of our courtship, led the carol and song, and played
for children and grown-ups to dance; Henry James
sat in the ingle nook and told us ghost-stories of his
making wholly in keeping with the place; George
Meredith watched and made shrewd comments on
the characteristics and possible careers of our various
children, and discoursed on every topic&mdash;always
expecting the homage due to him and reserving
the conversation, even from Joe, by a long-drawn
&ldquo;Ah&mdash;&rdquo; until he was ready with his next
paradox.</p>

<p>Yet there was a moment when Joe scored even off
Meredith. I think he tells the tale in <cite>Coasting
Bohemia</cite>, but not of himself. Meredith had been
criticizing George Eliot, and in a brief pause, Joe
put in: &ldquo;Yes! Panoplied in all the philosophies
she swoops upon the commonplace.&rdquo; And Meredith,
laughing, replied, &ldquo;I wish I had said that
myself!&rdquo;</p>

<p>One day we were busy amusing the children in
the big Hall with a game of Definitions; one wrote
down a word for Subject, the next man defined, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>the third&mdash;the paper being turned over the Subject&mdash;&ldquo;recovered&rdquo;
it.</p>

<p>Thus: Subject, <em>Soap</em>; Definition, as made by
Joe: <cite>The Horror of the East-end multitude</cite>. Recovery,
<cite>Jack the Ripper</cite>: the nickname of the celebrated
East-end murderer who was then the talk of the
whole town.</p>

<p>Joe was leaving that day for London, and the
man came to announce that the trap was at the
door.</p>

<p>He rose to go, but the children had begun another
definition for his &ldquo;last.&rdquo; <em>Woman</em> was given as
the word. <em>The Better Half</em>, wrote the next
person.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only just time to make the train, Sir,&rdquo; said the
footman.</p>

<p>The children wailed, and we all followed him out
of the hall and saw him off; but half an hour later a
telegram was handed to our hostess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Recovery: <em>An Angel once removed</em>&rdquo;; and
nobody needed to hear the signature.</p>

<p>The children were always the frame to the picture
in that lovable household, and our daughter&mdash;the
apple of her father&rsquo;s eye, made in his mould, gifted
with his humour and large with his urbane and
generous heart&mdash;had a very special place there. I
remember his pride when George Meredith watching
her one day at his feet, said: &ldquo;Look at the bumps
on that child&rsquo;s head. Always let her pursue whatever
walk in life she chooses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His advice was followed; and she <i>knew</i> what she
would choose. I was having her trained for a
violinist (for her gifts were several) and her master
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>was proud of her at twelve years old. But at
fourteen she came to us one day and said: &ldquo;Father,
I hope you won&rsquo;t mind: I&rsquo;ve sold my violin. I
know now that I want to draw&mdash;and no one can
serve two masters so I&rsquo;ve put away the temptation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joe was generally the centre around whom the children
mustered in those good days, and many an extra
ten minutes did he beg off their bedtime in the
summer twilight or by the big Christmas logs. He
used to tell them that he hated going to bed himself,
and nothing was more true.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I didn&rsquo;t know that your mother always gives
me cotton sheets,&rdquo; he would say on a winter&rsquo;s night,
&ldquo;I would never go. I&rsquo;ve no fancy for a country
trip every time I turn round in bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But indeed he needed no such excuse for sitting
up late when he had a congenial audience. He had
a wonderful capacity for sound sleep when the time
came&mdash;a capacity equalled, as he expressed it, for
&ldquo;enjoying&rdquo; laziness; because, of exercise&mdash;save
in the pursuit of bird or fish&mdash;he would have none;
but most of his life he sat up late and his most
welcome form of rest was always in talk.</p>

<p>In this relaxation he was even more than matched
in argumentativeness by the husband of another
most hospitable hostess, to whom he addresses the
following letter after a long visit when she had
housed us in a homeless interval. I may add that
our host was an etymologist, and would confront
Joe with a dictionary in support of his own view of
a disputed word; also that he was an eminent
amateur musician and a vehement Wagnerian.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="smcap">&ldquo;My Dear &mdash;&mdash;,</span></p>

<p>It seems to me that you and your husband
ought to be told that you are excellent hosts&mdash;and
yet I don&rsquo;t want the thing to get about. At first
I thought that I would declare loudly to all whom
I met how pleasant a thing it was to stay in your
house; and then I thought I wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>When one has discovered a really charming place
where one can live with exclusive regard to one&rsquo;s
own selfish indulgence, it is perhaps hardly wise to
noise it abroad. Some of the snuggest corners in
Europe have been ruined by such imprudent chatter;
and I feel that I should never forgive myself if I
were to be the means of making it generally known
that your house is so delightful. But I think after
all that I can trust you!</p>

<p>You are not the sort of person to gossip about
such a thing; and when I tell you that what I am
going to say is confidential, I simply mean that I
would not, for the present at any rate, mention the
subject to your daughter; young people are fanciful,
and she might misinterpret my meaning&mdash;besides
why shouldn&rsquo;t she find it out for herself? No, let
this be for you and your husband&rsquo;s ear alone!
And even for you it must be in some sense a barren
secret; you cannot stay with yourselves! If you
could I should recommend nothing so strongly as a
few weeks&rsquo; visit to your charming home. It would
do your husband all the good in the world&mdash;get him
out of himself, so to speak&mdash;while it would make you
a different woman. Not that I think that in any
way desirable; I simply avail myself of a phrase
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>that is always applied to me when a change is
recommended.</p>

<p>Yes! If you could only stay at&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p>The family is small, but extremely intelligent,
with minds well stored with the most varied kinds
of knowledge.</p>

<p>Your host is a type!</p>

<p>Waking&mdash;with him&mdash;appears to be the momentary
interruption of an animated conversation which has
engaged the long hours others reserve for sleep.</p>

<p>With them a new day seems to open a new volume
with cover, title page and preface. Not so with him.</p>

<p>The intervening night is simply a semi-colon in an
uncompleted sentence&mdash;a Wagnerian clause in a
melody that repudiates a close. This might seem
to argue a too rigid adherence to a single theme
with menace of monotony. Yet nothing could be
less true.</p>

<p>At the bidding of a single word the whole scene
changes with the shifting magic of a dream, and you
are surprised to find yourself suddenly plunged into
quite another conversational sea.</p>

<p>I have seen visitors at your house who would turn
a deaf ear to these alert exercises of the dawn&mdash;moody
men who became at once absorbed in the
mere pleasures of the table; taking refuge in bacon
from arguments to which they could find no auroral
reply. They are cowards and I will have none of
them! Rather would I emulate the tact of your
hostess who finds, and welcomes, in these wide-ranging
thoughts of morn, a bulwark that keeps the
host from the kitchen boiler. For he is very apt to
descend suddenly from his philosophic heights and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>pounce with unerring precision on some petty
domestic error.</p>

<p>It is here you may observe the sweet influence of
the daughter of the house, whose finesse would almost
deserve the name of cunning if its purpose were not
so benign.</p>

<p>In her skilful hands I have seen disaster averted
by a dictionary and an impending storm transferred
from a tea-cup to a disputed line of Tennyson.</p>

<p>I am painting for you only the lighter moods of
life at this charming house; of what else is delightful
you must some day go and see for yourself. But I
forget; of course you can&rsquo;t and there is my difficulty
staring me in the face. I wonder if it is mine alone?</p>

<p>I find it so easy to trace a smile to its source:
so difficult to define the lasting charm that lies
behind it!</p>

<p>And even when the definition is at hand my
tongue halts at eulogy. Odd! I love to be praised
and remembrance offers no instance when I have
been in fear lest appreciation should sink to flattery.
But when I try to praise others&mdash;even as they
deserve&mdash;I am overtaken by a feeling of delicacy
on their behalf which I have never felt for myself.
And so I end dumb on the very threshold of my
theme.</p>

<p>I should like to say a great number of things of
you and your husband, but somehow it doesn&rsquo;t
seem possible. Some day, when I meet a stranger
in the train at one of those odd moments when by
some irresistible impulse, I am driven to confide
to a chance acquaintance secrets that through a
long life I have hidden from my dearest friends&mdash;I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>shall say something about you and him that you
might like to hear. But I can&rsquo;t command the hour
and meanwhile, you see, I am no further than when
I began. All I can say is that, if ever you ask me
to your house again, let nothing be changed from
what it was, for it could not be changed for the
better.</p>

<p>After this epistle it may not be thought partial
on my part to state that, from the days of our
youthful visits to Balcarres to the end of his life,
my husband was a welcome guest at country houses;
the following, in reply to a request from Mrs. F. D.
Millet of Broadway, that he should relieve the strain
of a spell of female society upon her husband, seems
to show this.</p>

<p class="space-above2"></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="smcap">&ldquo;My Dear Mrs. Millet,</span></p>

<p>I ought not, but I will! And lest I should
falter in my bad resolution, I have already wired
to you saying I should be down on Saturday.</p>

<p>It is a strange thing about duty. I believe there
is no one who sees what is facetiously called &ldquo;the
path of duty&rdquo; more clearly than I do; but we
are differently gifted, and I fancy I never was
intended to walk in it. Like the criminal who
acquires in the end an extensive knowledge of law
by industriously incurring its penalties, I believe
that if I could recall all the moral maxims I have
neglected in practice, I might serve as a veritable
storehouse of wisdom and good conduct. And so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>it happens that, though I see clearly I ought to
stay in town and work, I am nevertheless determined
to accept your kind invitation and come to you on
Saturday next. Tell Frank to defer suicide till
after that date.</p>

<p>I can indeed well understand his melancholy.
No man can dwell long in the exclusive society of
women without being crushed by the sense of his
own unworthiness. We are not fit for it. I often
wish there were some bad women in the world, with
whom we might associate in our baser moments,
and sometimes, in a dreary mood, I am apt to
wonder what women can have been like before the
Fall, they are so perfect now.</p>

<p>Perhaps in another world we shall be better and
you will be worse; let us hope for the best.</p>

<p>And in the meantime let not Frank despair.
When I see him on Saturday I will do my best to
detach his nose from the grindstone and tune his
unaccustomed lips to words that were once familiar
to us both.</p>

<p class="center">Yours ever truly,</p>
<p class="name-r"><span class="smcap">J. W. Comyns Carr.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>In those earlier days he sometimes pretended that
his wardrobe was unfitted for such places, but
I think even this was but a shallow piece of mock
modesty on his part, for he was well aware that he
could shine if he liked in any environment.</p>

<p>A letter to my sister, which I have just found,
may illustrate this:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">19, Blandford Square,</span></p>
<p class="name-r">N.W.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&ldquo;My Dear Alma,</span></p>

<p>Many thanks for the brushes. When my
hair is gone&mdash;&ldquo;which will be short,&rdquo; as Pellegrini
says&mdash;I can use them for sweeping a crossing. In
the meantime they make a most excellent parting.
Seriously they are beautiful.</p>

<p>I have never before had brushes in a case&mdash;it
seems to lift one&rsquo;s social status. Hitherto my
brushes have lain in my portmanteau cheek by jowl
with my boots, or have mingled their tears with
my sponge.</p>

<p>Now all is changed; I feel I could stay at a
country house and meet the footman on equal terms.
Of course, I don&rsquo;t mean that seriously&mdash;no man
could hope to be the equal of a footman. I am a
democrat but no revolutionist, and I have always
felt that so long as liveried servants keep their
supremacy the throne is safe. Compared with this
the land question is a trifle. &ldquo;Dieu et mon drawers&rdquo;
is the loyal but terrified sentiment with which I
always awake on a visit, and see the footman turning
my tattered underclothing inside out. But now my
brushes will save me.</p>

<p class="center">Yours,</p>
<p class="name-r"><span class="smcap">Joe.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>In the later years of his life, as his friends multiplied
far and wide and his social gifts became famous,
he was pressed into circles unknown to me, and our
country-house visits together became fewer; so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>that personally I remember his talk oftener at some
sea-side place where we had run down for a week-end,
or on the verandah of some foreign hotel where he
would be immediately surrounded by a delighted
audience&mdash;in later years not by any means always
composed of his own countrymen. Though his
associations with French artists and men of letters
over pictures for the New Gallery&mdash;and, more still,
over his English editorship of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L&rsquo;Art</i>&mdash;had taught
him enough of their tongue for his business, he was
not a finished French scholar; but he was never
afraid to make a shot at expressing his thought,
and consequently he improved enormously at the
end of his life. I remember the astonished comment
of two Armenian lads and a charming Finnish lady
whom we met at a Swiss mountain resort: &ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mais
c&rsquo;est &eacute;patant! De faire des calembours comme cela
dans une langue &eacute;trang&egrave;re.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>He only needed an audience; and he had it every
hour of the day in those two Armenian boys, who
would stand for hours watching him throw his line
over the lake and coax the fish out&mdash;just, they used
to say, as he would coax the children to him in the
roads or the visitors in the lounge&mdash;&ldquo;sans se donner
de la peine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I am not sure of the justice of that last remark.
Perhaps he never purposely gave himself trouble,
but he amused others because his love of his own kind
was such that he must always needs be in touch with
them, be they peasant or peer, and at the end of
his life he preferred to lounge in the road and chat
with the convalescent soldiers in a quiet village than
to sit comfortably in the seclusion of a lovely garden.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>
<p>It was because he was always alive that he was
not dull; but I must admit he needed plenty of
human interest to keep him so.</p>

<p>And I think, for this reason, that the life of a
good hotel, preferably a foreign one, afforded him
the best opportunities for fun; he knew just how
much or how little the applause of such kaleidoscopic
society was worth; but it tickled his appetite
for the moment and was the required sauce to his
holiday rest.</p>

<p>The following letters to his daughter variously
illustrate this aspect of him:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="name-rr"><span class="smcap">Eden Hotel,</span></p>
<p class="name-r"><span class="smcap">Monte Carlo.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">&ldquo;My dear Doll,</span></p>

<p>Our little hotel at Monte Carlo is a cosy
place, containing among its visitors some odd and
rather lonely females, both English and American.
I overheard a conversation the other night between
four of them&mdash;two English and two Americans&mdash;at
which your mother would like to have assisted.
They evidently did not know that we were English,
and let themselves go on the subject of the male sex.
The leader of the band, an American lady, whose
hips described a circle about as big as the Round
Pond in Kensington Gardens, was especially vehement
in denouncing us, though I can hardly conceive
she had ever received any other cause of resentment
than neglect. To an English lady, who could not
compete with her in size but fairly distanced her
in ugliness, she held forth at great length on the
superior advantages which women enjoyed in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
America. &ldquo;Over there,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve just
got men like <i>that</i>,&rdquo; and she placed an enormous
thumb on a morsel of unresisting bread to indicate
where men were. &ldquo;If they do anything we don&rsquo;t
like, why, Madam, they hear from us pretty quick.
And that&rsquo;s where they ought to be,&rdquo; she added,
&ldquo;for they are just nothing but savages!&rdquo; At
which the gruesome English woman said that that
was what she had always held to; but that, in
England, she never could find any woman with the
courage to say so. Then the fat American gave her
country away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But see now,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve still got to fight
the law even in our country. I said to an American
man, &lsquo;do you love your wife?&rsquo; &lsquo;Why, of course,&rsquo;
he said. &lsquo;Do you love your mother?&rsquo; I said.
&lsquo;Just don&rsquo;t I,&rsquo; he replied. &lsquo;Do you love your
sister?&rsquo; &lsquo;Why sure,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Well then,&rsquo; I
said to him, &lsquo;Do you know the American constitution
declares that every living citizen should have
a vote except children, criminals <em>and women</em>.&rsquo;
And then she turned to the English woman and
added: &ldquo;Do you know, Madam, the thought of
that American law just makes me blush all over
when I go to bed at night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I confess as I looked at her, I couldn&rsquo;t think of
the unrighteous law, for my mind was filled with the
idea of what a wild and billowy tract of country
that blush would have to traverse. Fancy the
Round Pond turned into the Red Sea with a single
blush.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&ldquo;My dearest Doll,</span></p>

<p>We are in the midst of a thunderstorm
that is tearing and raging round the mountains;
for the moment it is like Mr. Chamberlain in the
earlier part of his campaign&mdash;very loud and very
near, but I think it is taking itself off to the Gotthard.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think I have told you of the two little bits
of American character I encountered at my hotel.
One evening three ladies of that country were set
beside me at table d&rsquo;hote. They were not pre-possessing
or young, but I noticed with just a
momentary flush of flattery that there was an
obvious struggle going on as to which of them
should occupy the chair next to me; the struggle
ended, and then the next but one turned to the
victor and said, &lsquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you see, my dear, that
I just wanted to protect you in case you might be
addressed in a manner that might offend you.&rsquo;
Poor dears! they didn&rsquo;t know that God had protected
them against any attack of mine.</p>

<p>Later, two rather nice girls and their mother
took the same places; and one evening after dinner,
when the terrace was full of people, the mother
looked up to where one of the girls was standing
at the window of the room above, and called out:
&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t let him kiss you, dear.&rsquo; We all turned to
look up, and there stood the girl with a parrot on
her shoulder. There was naturally an audible
smile among the spectators, and the girl herself was
in fits of laughter.</p>

<p>We are very comfortable in our little hotel
here, with two nice Italian brothers to cater for us.
The Italian village children please me mightily,
and I hobble about in their language with just
enough understanding to enable me to amuse myself.</p>

<p>We are an odd society: nearly all women,
American and English. They are mostly nice
people in their way, but not exciting, and of the
place generally it may be said that whatever other
attractions it may possess it does not seem to be
a health resort for beauty. The air apparently is
not recommended for pretty people. In the streets
and on the hills the German is more or less in
evidence, and sometimes as I pass them by I am
inclined to side with Balfour and to demand that
four more Dreadnoughts should be laid down at once.
Their admiration of nature somehow always makes
me feel shy, and I can almost see the landscape
making an ugly face after their loudly proclaimed
<em>Wundersch&ouml;n</em>. However, they really don&rsquo;t trouble
us much&mdash;the neighbourhood is so genuinely
beautiful.</p>

<p>He often touched on the beauties of nature as
related to art when writing to his artist daughter,
and I find this keen little bit of criticism in a letter
to her from Bellagio.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;This place is beautiful, and makes one wonder
little that the Italians thought of landscape as a
thing of design before the Northerners found a new
beauty in the empire of cloud and sky. Certainly
these mountains have great enchantment of form,
and the Southern light defines every detail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And this longer letter of varying interest also
rings the same note.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">&ldquo;My dear Doll,</span></p>

<p>Here is a line from me whom I daresay
you thought hopeless in that matter. But such a
little thing will sometimes provoke a sinner to
virtue. Two strangely fashioned men share the
room adjoining mine, divided from me only by a
washed deal partition held together by French nails.
They spend the day in moody silence and in grey
frock coats which if they were well cut would suit
the Cup Day at Ascot. But they return at nine
and chatter unceasingly till 10.30. It is now only
ten and it has occurred to me that instead of tossing
about on the sea of their incoherent conversations
I would write a line to you.</p>

<p>This is a beautiful place which I should admire
even more if nobody else admired it. But it is made
too fair to go scot free of praise, and so I must fain
clap my hands with the rest. You see we are
exclusive in our emotions as the society of a country
town and do not wish to share them with our
inferiors. That is a part of it, but I think my
reluctance to hear nature applauded has a better
reason too, though it is hard to give it words. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>know I always feel a better right to enjoy its beauty
when I am otherwise engaged, in killing a bird
perhaps, in fishing a stream or I suppose best of
all in some sort of labour that the needs of the
world demand.</p>

<p>I went for an early walk the other day up to the
Wengern Alp; all the mountain in shadow and the
pines blacker than their own fallen image on the
grass. I was alone and met no one on the path
but the lads laden with their washed deal milk-pails
as they came singing from every green hill. And
as they passed I felt sort of shamefaced. I was out
for beauty, a kind of dilettante wandering in search
of impressions, and I knew deep down in me that
they must one day and another have won impressions
I could never gain. No one can be really intimate
with a strange land, can ever really read the face
of a hillside as it is read by those however simple
who were born to see it coloured by the changing
fortunes of their life from childhood to manhood.
Nature is so shy, so reluctant to speak if she thinks
she is overheard, but she will sing to herself when
she thinks we are busy.</p>

<p>For us who are not artists I think beauty is only
really captured in that way. It is trapped unawares,
stolen in the silences of night or dawn, or burnt
into the brain by the fire of some passionate moment
to which it remains as an unforgotten background.
Of course the artist, the poet or the painter, has
other rights and other penalties. &lsquo;He that would
save his life must lose it,&rsquo; and the artist is always
giving up for himself what he re-fashions for the
joy of others. He is like the cuckoo that sojourns
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>in every nest and is itself but a homeless voice.
Even the beauty that he pursues is never really
possessed; it flutters for a moment in his hand
and then takes wing for others to inherit. It is
bought so dearly and then sold for a mere song.</p>

<p>But this is a digression. We were talking of
Switzerland, and I do believe this is one of the
choicest spots in it, but of course we don&rsquo;t discuss
its merits all day. On the contrary, I think we
talk most of the food, comparing the veal of yesterday
with the mutton of to-day, wondering from what
strange waters, remote or near, come those strange
fish that masquerade under the titles of the dwellers
in Northern seas. And then we pry into the lives
of other lodgers, making up imaginary relationships
among families that are as normally related as our
own&mdash;taking a curious interest in characters in
which we have really no concern, and exchanging
cards warmly with parting guests, knowing that
we shall see their faces again no more. And all the
while the air is so good, when the weather is not
so bad, that we feel well, which is a long way on the
road to feeling happy, and we are sometimes pointed
at as distinguished, and then vanity covers the rest
of the road and we are very jolly.</p>

<p>His preference for a foreign holiday&mdash;unless one
in his own country, could be allied to fishing or
shooting&mdash;did not, as will be understood from
stray remarks in his correspondence, extend to
Germany. He always disliked the race, and I can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>recollect a journey in our young days during which
we had made a halt at Munich with Beatty Kingston.
I am afraid Joe&rsquo;s description of the place and the
people included such scathing epithets as &ldquo;The
Burial-place of the Peto-Baptists&rdquo; and &ldquo;The
Suburb of the World.&rdquo; For his excuse I must note
that it was the bad season for the Opera, although
we did once hear &ldquo;The Flying Dutchman,&rdquo; which
he particularly admired; also that the old Pinacotek,
with its riches in Paintings by Old Masters, was
closed, as if to spite him; naturally he could not be
consoled by &ldquo;the collection of middle-aged articles&rdquo;
offered him as a salve&mdash;declaring that he saw plenty
of these in the streets of the town.</p>

<p>He was always just as hard on the German
&ldquo;frau&rdquo; as on her husband, and his description of
them on the mountain paths at Gastein, with skirts
looped up like window blinds and waterproofs
strapped across their shoulders in case of a storm,
could only be equalled by the whimsical words he
had for the red necks of the men bulging over their
collars.</p>

<p>He was not a Central Europe man; the French
or the Italians were always first with him after his
own people. <em>Romance</em> for him lay in the North;
I have often heard him insist that those most deeply
possess it who dwell in the mist and dream of the
sun, and he would cite &ldquo;The Wizard of the North&rdquo;
and the Scottish Land in proof of his theory: yet
the South stood for gaiety with him, and he sighed
for the sun even as I did who had been bred
in it.</p>

<p>It is curious that Rome he only saw for the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>time late in life, upon being chosen to write the
introduction to the British Section of the International
Exhibition there, and afterwards appointed
England&rsquo;s representative on the Art Congress.</p>

<p>I shall quote a private appreciation of the written
part of his work from that acute and sympathetic
critic, Edward Russell of the <cite>Liverpool Post</cite>.</p>

<p>I cannot refrain from congratulating you
on your Introduction to the Roman Catalogue of
British Paintings, etc. Not only its literary felicity,
but its fine and illuminating judgment; the choiceness
of the language; and the apt biographical
illustrations; the humane diplomacy of occasional
gentle, but searching suggestions of censure; the
insight of the aper&ccedil;us; and the contribution of
several original maxims to the sterling floating

<p>But Rome as a city he loved not, as he loved the
Tuscan and Umbrian towns; its vast antiquities
oppressed him, its medieval structures he disliked,
and the race that had left its impress there bored
him; even in the natural surroundings he found
too much melancholy&mdash;definitely contrasted in his
mind with that Northern sternness which breeds
Romance; but he shall speak for himself.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>&ldquo;The archeological side of Rome I can only
gape at as a tourist: I have no learning that way:
though, of course, there are scenes of the old world
which touch the imagination without the kind of
knowledge that must, to those who possess it, make
the place deeply interesting. The more modern
Rome&mdash;the Rome of the Renaissance, scarcely makes
a single appeal and creates no such satisfying atmosphere
as Florence. The Sistine I must see again;
the light was bad to-day and the effect at so great a
height did not immediately leave the tremendous
impression of Michael Angelo&rsquo;s power that comes
of the more intimate knowledge given by our photographs.
The colour, however, yielded more than
I had expected. Tell Fred if he is by you that I
am wholly at one with him about the Stanze of
Raphael. They gain in site, and although I knew
the compositions well, I found them better than I
knew with a charm of colour unexpected and superior
to any of his easel pictures, except perhaps the
Madonna at Dresden; truly a marvellous genius,
using all the resources of style with the freedom and
ease of a painter of genre&mdash;and here, which is not
always so in his later work, absolutely free from
rhetoric in gesture: I must go back to them again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the general style of Roman Renaissance
building I have no delight&mdash;and never thought to
have; but, of course, there are separate things
to discover that I have as yet not had time to see.
But St. Angelo makes a great barbaric pile that is
mightily impressive. St. Peter&rsquo;s seems to me much
less noble in general effect than St. Paul&rsquo;s, and its
interior ornament, painting and sculpture, seemed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>on a swift view, to be a wilderness of that kind of
art I don&rsquo;t love&mdash;all except Michael Angelo&rsquo;s <em>Piet&agrave;</em>,
which stood out in modest simplicity and intensity
amid the garish surroundings.</p>

<p>I lunched with Barr&egrave;re again to-day, and
afterwards we went in his motor to the lakes of
Nemi and Albano. It was a very interesting drive,
and the lakes are really beautiful, though in a grave
and sombre way. Of course it was not bright
sunlight, but in any case the landscape here has a
peculiar character. It has an ancient and desert
look, hardly joyous and not very fruitful, different
entirely in this respect from the landscape around
Florence. But it has character, and what one may
call style: and the remains of ruined buildings,
aqueduct or tomb, which cut the sky at every turn,
seem to belong to these surroundings. The landscape
is of their date, seems almost to have remained
of their date, and not to have found the renewed
youth which mocks antiquity in other kinds of
scenery. A certain gravity is the prevailing sentiment&mdash;impressive
but touched with sadness.</p>

<p>I am seeing isolated bits of Rome little by little.
If I were settled here for long I think the sculpture
would attract me as a study&mdash;but like everything
else in the way of art in Rome one has to be constantly
sifting and sorting the good from the bad.
Here as elsewhere there is a mass of indifferent
achievement, a mass of work either poorly copied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>from the Greek or poorly conceived and lacking
vitality. One feels more and more that the Romans
were not artists&mdash;great collectors I have no doubt,
and perhaps connoisseurs&mdash;but without the finest
fire of the spirit. There are a few great things here
that are superb, and others doubtless which I
haven&rsquo;t seen, but in many instances of even admired
things there is not the saving quality of life that
makes Phidias seem modern as well as great.</p>

<p>Touching this last criticism he made us laugh
when he got home by saying that he longed to cry
to the crowds who patiently paced the Vatican
galleries, guide-book in hand: &ldquo;Go out into the
sunshine, dear people, and enjoy your lunch&mdash;this
is all bosh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was delightful to me the other day to find a
perfect echo of these sentiments in the letters of the
late Mr. Stopford Brooke to his daughters. But it
is not the only instance in those enthralling volumes
where I noted a remarkable likeness in many of the
views, and even in the method of expressing them,
of these two brilliant Irishmen.</p>

<p class="center">FISHING HOLIDAYS</p>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">I had</span> not known my husband six months before I
knew him for an enthusiastic fisherman. He tells
in his Reminiscences of the first teaching he had
from a reprobate old peasant in the Lake Country,
and the passion for it never left him; the happiest
of his summer days were spent in the pursuit of it
and, from the time when I&mdash;set to watch a float
while he threw a line further down the stream&mdash;allowed
the fish to escape, to an evening towards the
close of his life when I helped his unsteady steps
to the bank of the Windrush at Burford, his
characteristic grey felt hat stuck full of flies and the
graceful gesture with which his long line was flung
back and forward and then laid softly on the water
of some quiet stream, are among the things which
I often recall.</p>

<p>I can see him now, on that first holiday, stumbling
with his swaying rod down the rocky bed of the
Dove with the sunset behind him, while I sat waiting
on a grassy bank eager to know what sport he had
had as soon as he was within earshot. He was a
most expert angler; and that was the beginning of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>many happy fishing trips&mdash;in Derbyshire and Westmoreland,
on the Tweed at Peebles and the lochs
and rivers of Perthshire, Argyllshire and Sutherland;
but most notably on the stretch of a Hertfordshire
stream which he rented for some years with other
friends, and where he could best exercise his skill
with the dry fly.</p>

<p>A tiny cottage, just big enough for three men or for me and the
children, stood on the edge of the water, which was crossed by a
plank bridge. Sometimes, when there was no one else, I would be
allowed&mdash;most alarming of experiences!&mdash;to use the landing
net, and I think any of his angling comrades&mdash;A. E. W. Mason,
Seymour Hicks, Sam Sothern and others&mdash;would sympathise with my
terror over the responsibility.</p>

<p>I think there were no happier days in my husband&rsquo;s life than
those spent in that Hertfordshire cot, and there is no frame into which
his figure fits more familiarly than the sedgy bank of that sunlit
river, hemmed by boldly contrasting forget-me-not and marshmallow,
with the May-fly flitting over the sparkling ripples and the shaded
pools.</p>

<p>And nothing so helped his periods of creative
work as this rural recreation.</p>

<p>It was on the shores of Loch Rannoch that he
wrote the first Acts of his <cite>King Arthur</cite> for Henry
Irving, and on the banks of the Lea that he saw the
barge bearing the body of the Fair Elaine. The
Black Mount at the foot of the loch may have stood
for the rugged rocks around Camelot, and the limpid
stream dividing emerald meadows at eventide, for
the river that circled Arthur&rsquo;s Halls.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>
<p>He was wont whimsically to declare that the
&ldquo;gaslights of Piccadilly&rdquo; were more satisfying to
him than a country life unless enhanced by the
pleasure of sport; but no one saw the beauties
of Nature in the intervals of sport more sympathetically
than he did, as he tells for himself in <cite>Coasting
Bohemia</cite>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>&ldquo;I sometimes think,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;that those
who haunt the country, without conscious sense of
its many beauties, are apt to learn and love its
beauties best. How often the memory of a day&rsquo;s
shooting is indissolubly linked with the pattern of
a fading autumn sky, when we have stood at the
edge of a stubble field wondering whether the growing
twilight will suffice for the last drive. And if this
is true of other forms of sport, it is everlastingly
true of fishing. There is hardly a remembered day
on a Scotch loch, or beside a southern stream, which
has not stamped upon it some unfading image of
landscape beauty. It was not for that we set forth
in the morning, for then the changing lights in a
dappled sky counted for no more than a promise
of good sport; during those earlier hours there is no
feeling but a feeling of impatience to be at work;
and the splash of a rising trout, before the rod is
joined and ready and the line run through its rings,
is heard with a sense of half-resentment lest we
should have missed the favourable moment of the
day. But as the hours pass, the mind becomes
more tranquilly attuned to its surroundings. The
keenness of the pursuit is still there, but little by
little the still spirit of the scene invades our thoughts,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>and as we tramp home at nightfall the landscape
that was unregarded when we set forth upon our
adventure now seems to wrap itself like a cloak
around us with a spell that it is impossible to resist.
A hundred such visions, born of an angler&rsquo;s wanderings,
come back to me across the space of many
years. I can see the reeds etched against a sunset
sky, as they spring out of a little loch in the hills
above the inn at Tummel. And then, with a
changing flash of memory, the broad waters of
Rannoch are outspread, fringed by its purple hills.
And then, again, in a homelier frame, I can see
the willows that border the Lea, their yellow leaves
turned to gold under the level rays of the evening
sun; and I can hear the nightingale in the first
notes of its song as I cross the plank bridge that
leads me homeward to the cottage by the stream.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p>By which it will also be seen that his &ldquo;love of
laziness&rdquo; did not hinder him in the pursuit of sport.</p>

<p>Exercise for its own sake he resolutely refused
to take, and when my Alpine-enthusiast father
dragged him up a Piz&mdash;the last bit with his eyes shut&mdash;he
said: &ldquo;I shall never climb anything again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Seymour Hicks could tell a different tale of
a memorable evening on which he hooked a big
trout in the dusk&mdash;Joe teasing him as to its poor
weight&mdash;and when they stayed so late beside a
Scottish tarn to land it that their friends below
came up the mountain with lanterns to the rescue.</p>

<p>In Peeblesshire, too, he had gay hours with a
Captain Fearon, known to our children as <em>Plum-bun</em>,
because of a rhyme with which he teased them.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>
<p>This fine old sportsman&mdash;though he must have
been sixty at the time&mdash;walked twenty miles after a
day&rsquo;s sport so as to let Joe have the only spare
seat on a buggy that he might catch the night
express to town for work on the morrow. I can
see the tall handsome old man now on the moorside,
gaily waving adieu to Joe with a champagne
bottle which he had seized from the picnic basket
to cheer him on the road.</p>

<p>Joe had many days with him on the Tweed;
one of them, following such a big spate that an old
countryman wading in front of them was never seen
more after they had warned him against imprudently
breasting the swirl of the water where the river
made an abrupt bend ahead.</p>

<p>The gloom of this incident was partly mitigated
by their being told that the man was a drunkard
whose fate had often been so prophesied to him;
but they fished no more in a spate on the Tweed.</p>

<p>Fun was oftener their portion. I fancy it was to
Fearon that Joe made the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon-mot</i> current in the
Garrick Club, where he represented himself as
lunching with Noah on the Ark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must have good spate fishing here, Mr.
Noah,&rdquo; he reports himself as saying while they sat
smoking on the balcony overlooking the Flood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It <em>would</em> be good,&rdquo; replied the host, &ldquo;but
unluckily, you see, I have only two worms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He writes himself of his fishing on Loch Awe;
and later, on Loch Etive, as the guest of our charming
friend Alec Stevenson, whose cheery voice would
ask of his keeper after breakfast: &ldquo;Is it fishin&rsquo;
or shutin&rsquo; the day, Duncan?&rdquo; But there is no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>mention of a happy six weeks in Sutherlandshire
where we were chiefly fed by the guests &ldquo;killing&rdquo;
of the daily trout, proudly displayed at even upon
a large tray in the hall.</p>

<p>I think it was here that Joe had trudged for three
hours up a mountain with his fly-rod set up, to find&mdash;when
he reached the tarn at the top&mdash;that his
top joint had fallen off on the road; as he was alone
only the midges heard his remarks, for he had not
even his fourteen-year old son with him&mdash;the happy
companion of his later angling days. It was into
just such a tarn, that that boy fell off the boat
one day, when landing a trout, and was advised by
his father to run about in the natural state on the
moor while his clothes dried on a sun-baked rock.</p>

<p>A lovely place is Inchnadamph on blue Loch
Assynt; the great mountain that guards the
valley towards Lochinver can be golden in the long,
northern twilight, when the water that has been as
a sapphire before the sunset, becomes purple in the
gloaming; but oh! the midges! Useless to tie
our heads in bags and grease our faces: they penetrated
everywhere and &ldquo;bit like dogs.&rdquo; They
<em>almost</em> deterred Joe from his evening hour on the
water because of the landing afterwards, when the
pony would not stand for him to step into the
cart.</p>

<p>But nothing really deterred Joe from fly-fishing&mdash;neither
heat nor cold nor rain nor wind; he only
regarded the weather at those times from the point
of view of its influence on the sport. Even when
it was too bad for fishing he couldn&rsquo;t keep away
from the water. But he could never keep away
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>from water&mdash;he said it was the life of a landscape
as the blood is the life of the human body. In our
early days, when we were too poor for Highland
trips, visits to friends on the Thames afforded him
his best access to it; and, though he was not perhaps
a perfect oarsman, as may be proved by a &ldquo;stroke&rsquo;s&rdquo;
petition that he would not &ldquo;go so deep,&rdquo; to which
he replied: &ldquo;Ah, I never leave a stone unturned!&rdquo;&mdash;he
loved the &ldquo;noble river.&rdquo; Though for perfect
satisfaction he chose more swiftly running waters.</p>

<p>I came across some passages in one of Stopford
Brooke&rsquo;s letters which strangely call to mind Joe&rsquo;s
passion for a free stream.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no companion like a quick stream,&rdquo;
writes the older man; &ldquo;full, but not too full, capable
of shallows and water-breaks, with deep pools
when it likes and with a thousand shadows acquainted
with all the tales of the hills....&rdquo;</p>

<p>And once more: &ldquo;Running water surely is the
dearest and best-bred thing in the world. And a
great workman and a great artist.... Nor is there
any Singer, any Poet, any Companion so near and
dear as it is when it shapes itself into a mountain
stream in a quiet country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Often have I seen Joe beside such streams, and
though it so chanced that the last happy holiday we
had together was spent beside lakes rather than
rivers, the sense of moving water remains associated
in my mind with him through all the earlier days of
our life.</p>

<p>It was in Ireland&mdash;his motherland, though he had
never seen it till then&mdash;that we passed those last
unforgetable weeks of autumn.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>
<p>Even as we landed at Rosslare there seemed to
fall upon him an unnameable affinity with the country
of his blood; as we travelled slowly&mdash;very slowly&mdash;over
her truly emerald bosom, he sat in a dream
watching the little black cattle, that we afterwards
learnt to beware of for &ldquo;cross bastes,&rdquo; as they
cropped the sedgy meadows, his eyes wandering from
them to the tender Irish sky and then waking into
fun as he saw a peasant at a small station trip a
boy up unawares and cuff him soundly, laughing as
he did it.</p>

<p>And when we reached Waterford&mdash;only a dirty
town to me&mdash;he plunged at once among his people
and laughed joyously at the retort of a begging
urchin, whose pathetic plea of hunger he had pretended
to rail at: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where ye&rsquo;re wrong, yer
honour,&rdquo; the cheery little villain had cried: &ldquo;A
man may be fat and hungry too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The horse races were going on, and the inn was in
an uproar, which he sat up most of the night to
watch.</p>

<p>But the next day sleepy ways prevailed once more,
and it took us a long time to get off at the station,
where I recollect his amusement at the porter&rsquo;s
instruction: &ldquo;This way to America.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We reached Killarney without trunks, and the
conveyance sent to meet us broke down on the way
to the hotel; but he would meet no <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">contretemps</i>
save with a smile, and it was borne in on me that it
was because he was an Irishman that Italian happy-go-luckiness
had never ruffled him. So we fell in
with the leisurely ways of the land, and were fain to
&ldquo;enjoy the soft rain&rdquo; at that romantic spot and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>watch for the beautiful shapes of the hills to appear
out of the mists on the lake.</p>

<p>Next morning, however, that unique green-blue
sky, washed with rain and dappled with wisps of
cloud, smiled on us in faint sunshine, and from that
hour our journey was one passing from fair to fairer
scenes.</p>

<p>In a short time our train was climbing, or burrowing,
through perilous cliffs of granite, crowned with
lonely moors and, presently swooping down on
the glorious coast-line, that makes for Valencia
Island.</p>

<p>This we left on one side, and at Lough Caragh we
also did not halt, tempting as it was; for our
destination was Waterville, where we had rooms
booked at the charming Great Southern Hotel for
the fishing season; and after an hour or so more of
leisurely travel we reached Cahirciveen, where a
ramshackle trap waited to carry us over the moors
to the village that lies twixt sea and lough.</p>

<p>The whole journey, and the last of it not least,
was a revelation to him of which I think he was
proud to talk to me, and I certainly had formed no
notion of the beauties of <em>The Kingdom of Kerry</em>.
The rough road across the wild heather-moor was
bordered almost continuously with hedges of the
small purple-red fuchsia in full bloom, and the
cabins&mdash;white or pink-washed, with thatched roofs&mdash;that
we passed at rare intervals, were shaded with it
and covered with honeysuckle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You live in a fair country,&rdquo; said Joe to an old
man standing one day at the door of his tiny hovel;
and I&mdash;looking beyond him to the dim range of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>Macgillicuddy Reeks&mdash;added, &ldquo;and with beautiful
hills.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The visitors say &rsquo;tis fair, but I&rsquo;ve seen it <em>arl</em>
me life,&rdquo; replied the proprietor, with a quaint smile.
And then to me&mdash;&ldquo;but sure the Reeks are illigant
in winter wi&rsquo; the darlin&rsquo; snaws upon them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But that was later. That day we were silent with
contented fatigue till the muffled boom of the great
Atlantic breakers began to fall as distant thunder
on our ears: then suddenly Ballinskelligs&rsquo; Bay lay
before us with the massive headlands of Bolus and
Hog&rsquo;s Head guarding it from the Ocean.</p>

<p>The shore is wild and desolate with the sense
of the vast Atlantic ever present; but soon we
turned inland again towards the mountains of the
&ldquo;deep Glenmore,&rdquo; and there, under the purple
shadow of Mount Knockaline, lay a long, grave
Lough with a tiny deserted islet in its midst upon
which one of the ancient beehive cells stands under
the eaves of a ruined church. It is Lough Currane,
and we drove under overhanging fuchsias, to the
Great Southern Hotel on its shore.</p>

<p>We had two more beautiful drives while we were
in the <em>Kingdom of Kerry</em>: one along the perilous
Irish <em>Cornice</em>, known as the Coomakista Pass, where
one prayed one might not meet the coach, to Park-na-Silla;
the other from Kenmare over a rocky
road to Glengariff.</p>

<p>The Cornice drive beggars description, and I
never knew Joe to be so enthusiastic over a view.
Shallow little coves fringed with brilliant golden
seaweed&mdash;upon which herons stand feeding at times&mdash;indent
the shore itself; but the Sound is studded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>with numberless islets&mdash;some clad with heather,
others with semi-tropical shrubs, and faintly ringed
with the silver foam of a streaked and gentle sea.
In an opal haze beyond them, the opposite shore of
County Cork lies as a dream; but the two great
guardian cliffs of Ballinskelligs&rsquo; Bay with their
outriders&mdash;the Bull and Cow Rocks&mdash;stand in firm
and grand outline away whence we came where the
Sound joins the Ocean.</p>

<p>The coach driver draws up when he reaches the
best point, and tells us all about it, and points out
the Great Skellig Rock&mdash;twelve miles out to sea,
and close at hand the bridle path by which O&rsquo;Connell
rode over the mountains to his home at Darrynane.
As we near that Bay and its multitude of tiny
islets, upon one of which stands the ruined Monastery
of St. Finnan, he shews us the &ldquo;Liberator&rsquo;s&rdquo; very
house and then we turn inland again among undulating
moors&mdash;our road fenced with the fuchsia and
every variety of fern, till of a sudden the beautiful
bridge and square church tower of Sneem village seem
to beckon us into the very heart of a fiery sunset.</p>

<p>Our second drive from Kenmare was again quite
different and not without incident. In the first place
Irish unpunctuality caused us to start two hours
late, and in the second, when the carriage arrived at
last, the harness had to be tied up with cord before
we could proceed, a beginning which filled me with
alarm though it reminded me of youthful days in
Italy: but to Joe it only afforded opportunity for
pleasant raillery with his compatriot, and I only wish
I could remember all the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon-mots</i> with which they
capped one another.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>
<p>The last part of the ascent was very wild, but
when we emerged from the tunnel that pierces the
topmost granite cliff, the view that burst upon us&mdash;though
wild still in its freedom from the intrusion
of human interest, was soft and tender with all the
glamour of the South. Range upon range of finely-chiselled
hills stood crossing and re-crossing one
another with gentle valleys between, and the glint
of water here and there made visible by the golden
splash of sunset; and presently the hills&mdash;so soft
and so solemn upon the mellow evening sky&mdash;were
cleft to their base, and Bantry Bay lay spread in
the distance beneath us.</p>

<p>The road went down in sharp turns and, the
driver cheerfully remarking that we should have to
pass a motor-roller on the way, my heart jumped
into my mouth. But Joe administered a little
salutary chaff together with a cup of tea at the
wayside inn, where we changed drivers, and a pretty
girl assured me that &ldquo;Faith,&rdquo; I had &ldquo;no need to
fear, for the lad was the coolest whip on arl the
mountain-side.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So he was, but he went a fine pace, and the waiter
at the inn, who told us he was the girl&rsquo;s brother,
told us also that that cool lad was her lover, so
perhaps he was eager to show his prowess.</p>

<p>At Glengariff our weather was hot and fine, and
the water of that land-locked end of the Bay was so
calm that the pleasure boats round the jetty, and
indeed every tree on the shore and on the near
island, would lie reflected on its surface in the rosy
dawns or the golden sunsets as they do on the
Italian lakes. But out beyond the island the breeze
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>would freshen, and thither Joe hied him with a
friendly fisherman every morning to lie in wait for
the bass and the mackerel.</p>

<p>Our friends&mdash;Mr. and Mrs. Annan Bryce&mdash;owned
the beautiful island at the mouth of the bay, and
there we spent happy afternoons wandering over the
heather and gazing afar from the old castle&rsquo;s ruined
battlements; but Joe&rsquo;s mornings were his own,
and he would go even further out to sea than the
island, to where the seals sunned themselves on the
rocks, unscared by the approach of man, but scuttling
under water when the fishing-reel ran out, the old
ones calling their young to safety with an eerie
cry.</p>

<p>Perhaps Glengariff was the most lovely spot that
we saw, but the hothouse atmosphere of it made a
prolonged stay too trying, hence we enjoyed Waterville
and Lough Currane best, where the more
invigorating air of the open Atlantic in our wake
kept even the moisture of the valleys freshened
with soft breezes.</p>

<p>Also it is here that Joe rejoiced in the only branch
of angling that he really loved; sunshine, mist or
rain he was off on the lough with his faithful gillie,
his trout-rod set up, his old hat well-adorned with
every likely fly and, if necessary, his oilskins about
him.</p>

<p>It took him all his time&mdash;easy as it usually was
with him to make friends&mdash;to make them with that
gillie: a curiously sad and silent lad, whose rage at
the &ldquo;lack of pride&rdquo; in a besotted old poacher
who would hang about the landing-stage, knew no
bounds.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>
<p>But Joe would only laugh, and give the old
beggar the &ldquo;tanner&rdquo; that he begged &ldquo;for the
love of God,&rdquo; with a willing heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too hard on him,&rdquo; he would say to the
young boatman. But the boy had been in America,
and, as it presently appeared, was ashamed of the
lazy ways of his countrymen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Home Rule might be arl right,&rdquo; he would say&mdash;adding
shrewdly&mdash;&ldquo;if it don&rsquo;t keep the visitors&rdquo;
(generally meaning the English) &ldquo;away. But,
begorra, let us work for it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Few held such wide views even in that day, and Joe
could rarely get any one to talk on that favourite
topic of his; but he made various pleasant little
discoveries, one of which was that Catholic and
Protestant children worked together at school
without trouble; but then most of the latter were
fathered by English experts working at the Cable
Station and were ranked as &ldquo;visitors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His chief enjoyment when not fishing, was in the
cabins&mdash;when he could find excuse for entrance.
There was a weaver of the frieze not far from our
inn, and there we went to buy a length for a gift.
We were rewarded for a wet walk. The weaver
was out&mdash;but his wife sat by the peat-fire with a
new-born baby in her arms.</p>

<p>As we opened the door the cow that was in the
yard thrust in a soft nose to hold it ajar, and lo,
we beheld a sow within, rise slowly up and waddle
out, followed by ten wee sucking pigs: then the
cow stepped over the threshold beside us.</p>

<p>The woman rose asking us our errand, while I
edged away from the cow and tried to get out again.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll not harm ye, lady,&rdquo; said she with a smile,
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s her milkin&rsquo; time, and sure she knows I&rsquo;d not
take the darlin&rsquo; babe out in the rain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But it was not often that Joe spared time from
serious business for calling and sight-seeing. Once
we went to the Cable Station and learned, in an
amazing short time, from America, that the weather
was fine and dry; and on two occasions I went
with him to Lough Coppul (The Horse) away up in
the &ldquo;deep Glenmore&rdquo;; but that was only allowed
so that I might see the sleepy beauty of that tiny,
lonely lake, where the water is peat-brown even in
the sunlight; here I was introduced to two lovely
children with gold-red hair and deep eyes, who dwelt
in the schoolhouse of four districts, and were Joe&rsquo;s
special friends. This treat was a great favour
granted to me, nor was I admitted into the boat
even then, but had to roam about the shores while
work was done. Luckily it was fine and warm, and
the midges are not nearly so fierce in Ireland; and,
with the children&rsquo;s tales of the plights of scholars
coming over the mountains in winter and a shy
admission, warily coaxed out of them, as to the
presence of fairy horsemen there on All Hallowe&rsquo;en,
many an hour went by like a dream, till the gloaming
called us home.</p>

<p>But my lot was more often to sit reading or writing
on the terrace of the hotel watching for the boats
to round the point of <em>Church Island</em>, as they came
in with their catch to meals.</p>

<p>Whether anglers are men or women&mdash;and most
of the women in the Hotel were anglers&mdash;they mind
nothing but meals, and rarely the <em>hours</em> of those;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>so that I was mostly alone, but the excitement of
the &ldquo;basket&rdquo; was an event each time, and Joe&rsquo;s
was often the heaviest.</p>

<p>Through the gap in the fuchsia hedge, whose
tassels lay blood-red upon the lough&rsquo;s blue background
on a fine morning, I would first distinguish
his boat in the offing, and walk down to the landing-stage
to watch it nearing me between the shallows,
where those coal-black little &ldquo;cross&rdquo; bullocks stood
knee-deep on the emerald marshland. I can see
him, skilfully throwing his line on the water to the
last instant; then turning towards me with the
welcoming smile on his face always, though I
generally knew, before he had stepped ashore,
whether he had had good luck or not.</p>

<p>Yet the weather was not by any means always
fine, and many a day I sat in our little parlour,
not even seeing the fuchsia hedge, and certainly not
the water.</p>

<p>One wet day comes specially to my mind. It
had rained steadily, and out of the soft, white mist
that shrouded the lough, the sound of a tolling bell
had come eerily to me all the afternoon. I knew
of no church within two miles save the ruined one
on the Island, and at last I asked the chambermaid
what it might mean.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, it&rsquo;ll be a buryin&rsquo; on St. Finnan&rsquo;s Isle,&rdquo;
said she, crossing herself, after listening for a minute.
&ldquo;The family will still have the right of it, and they
keep a bell in the broken tower. But the corpse
will have come from far, poor sowl!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She went her way, and soon the bell ceased, and
almost at the same time the mist began to clear and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>the shapes of the black cattle to appear again on the
sedgy marshes, browsing as usual; then I saw
black boats&mdash;like phantom things&mdash;stealing away
in the distance and&mdash;behind them&mdash;a streak of
gold struck across the wet mountain-side and all the
mist shrank away, and the purple ridge was set
against that tender blue-green Irish sky, crossed with
bars of rosy light.</p>

<p>I went out and down the wet path to the landing-stage,
and there was Joe&rsquo;s boat pulling towards the
shore, and he standing up in it with a smile upon
his face.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That was our last holiday.</p>

<p>We were often out of London again, and in lovely
spots: in summer, at Studland in Dorset, at Broadway
and Burford in Oxon, at Ditchling in Sussex;
in winter, at Hastings and Bournemouth. But it
was always in search of health and to escape the
nerve-racking air-raids of War&mdash;never again in the
boyish spirit of holiday.</p>

<p>Yet let it not be supposed that Joe was ever
dismal. &ldquo;Comyns Carr is a good fellow and a boon
fellow,&rdquo; George Meredith wrote of him to another
old friend, and so he was to the last. Depressed now
and then, but hopeful again till near the end, and
always thankful for every bright moment and for
every kindness received. &ldquo;Grumbling is so dull,&rdquo;
he would say; and when I was dismayed at the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">contretemps</i> of travel lest they should affect his
comfort, he would beg me to &ldquo;bridge it over&rdquo;&mdash;as
he did.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>
<p>As we drove away from the house at Bournemouth
on our last journey he said to the landlady: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
never been so comfortable in any lodgings&rdquo;; yet
he had suffered much there, and had often lacked
luxuries unprocurable in war-time. Sometimes in
those days, after a long silence, I would ask him
what he was thinking of, and he would answer
simply: &ldquo;Nothing, dear!&rdquo; By which I am sure
he meant nothing troublous&mdash;and truly to the
wearying, harassing thoughts which beset many of
us he was a stranger&mdash;for he would sometimes add:
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve plenty to remember.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then, to the last, he worked part of every
day. His hand had not been able to write for long,
but he would dictate to a shorthand typist; the
whole of his <cite>Ideals of Painting</cite>, posthumously
published, was so written, and his precision never
flagged, as he instructed me over the correction of
those proofs&mdash;whether in regard to the letterpress
or to the re-production of the illustrations; the photogravure
after Rembrandt&rsquo;s <em>Mill</em> had been delayed,
and on the last day of his life he asked me if it had
come and if it &ldquo;looked well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Reading over his own words upon the waning of
his old friend, Sir John Millais&rsquo; life, they seem to me
unconsciously, yet so fitly, to describe himself, that
I shall end this effort to preserve some sort of a
portrait of him by quoting them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never heard from him,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;however
great the dejection of spirit he must have suffered,
a single sour word concerning life or nature. His
outlook on the world was never tainted by self-compassion,
never clouded by any bitterness of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>personal experience, and one came to recognise then&mdash;as
his life and strength gradually failed and waned&mdash;that
the spirit of optimism ... was indeed a
beauty deeply resident in his character, which even
the shadow of coming death was powerless to cloud
or darken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So I think of Joe as he stepped out of the boat on
Currane, with the smile upon his face.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
